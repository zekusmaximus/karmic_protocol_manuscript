## RESTRUCTURING NOTES

### **PACING ASSESSMENT**
- **Chapters 1-8**: Slow burn protocol development. Cut by 40%. Keep thematic moments, trim philosophy.
- **Chapters 9-21**: Slow burn institutional threat. Cut redundant strategy scenes. Keep only character-essential moments (Bud's crisis, Fiona's introduction).
- **Chapter 22-27**: Raid sequence + public fallout. **ESSENTIAL.** Keep intact with minimal cuts.
- **Chapter 28-35**: Acceleration phase. Compress slightly but preserve momentum.
- **Chapter 36-50**: Systemic collapse. Strong pacing. Minimal cuts.
- **Chapter 51-55**: Resolution. Keep intact.

### **CHARACTER ARC ANCHORS**
- **Bud**: Begins as willing accomplice (Ch 2) → Moral crisis (Ch 26) → Redemption (Ch 52-55)
- **Fiona**: By-the-book agent (Ch 22-24) → Doubts (Ch 33) → Defection (Ch 51)
- **Tim**: Idealist developer (Ch 1-3) → Strategist (Ch 14-28) → Fulfilled purpose (Ch 54)
- **Georgia**: Business strategist (Ch 6-27) → Uses protocol (Ch 34) → Sanctuary guide (Ch 54)
- **Sherry**: Prototype success (Ch 1) → Confined (Ch 41) → Free community (Ch 54)

### **THEMATIC THROUGHLINES** (Revised)

**PRIMARY CONFLICT LAYERS:**
1. **Awakening vs. Institutional Control**: Chapters 1, 24, 33, 51, 54-55
   - What the protocol does (Ch 1)
   - Government tries to suppress it (Ch 24, 33)
   - Institutions fail, enlightenment spreads (Ch 51, 54-55)

2. **Systemic Collapse as Necessary Precondition**: Chapters 31, 33, 45-50
   - Domino theory introduced (Ch 31, 33)
   - Institutions fragment (Ch 45-50)
   - New equilibrium emerges (Ch 54-55)

3. **Personal Awakening vs. Institutional Loyalty**: Throughout
   - Bud's arc (Ch 2, 9, 26, 36, 52-55)
   - Fiona's arc (Ch 22, 33, 39, 46, 51)
   - Sherry's persistence (Ch 1, 41, 54)

**CHARACTER INTRIGUE (Not Structural Conflict):**
- **O'Hearn / Cray / Fiona subplot**: Chapters 10-11, 15, 24-26, 30, 38, 43
   - Function: Deepens complicity, shows how power operates
   - Shows institutional corruption from inside (Fiona's defection arc)
   - O'Hearn wins corporate battle but loses access to protocol (Ch 30, 38, 43)
   - **Not a separate conflict layer**—illustrates institutional rot, not competing agenda

**SECONDARY THEMES:**
- **Love & Personal Connection**: Chapters 2, 26, 36, 52, 55
   - Bud & Cheryl (marriage strain, reconciliation)
   - Bud & son George (existential stakes, future)
   - Personal relationships as grounding force amid systemic chaos

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Confirm which scenes are essential** for Act I opening (Ch 24 + supporting)
2. **Mark scenes for compression vs. cutting** using status field
3. **Populate the `links` field** with scene dependencies
4. **Create a restructuring map** showing old chapter → new position
5. **Draft opening 50 pages** with restructured Act I
