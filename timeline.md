Timeline: The Karmic Protocol

Chronology Overview
- Early 2026: Georgia begins quiet fabrication setup via shells/subsidiaries (pre-production groundwork).
- Dec 2026 (inferred): Sherry’s enlightenment ≈ eight months before the Aug 2027 tablet‑factory raid.
- July 2027: Legislative/VR conference; Tim’s talk; transcripts/videos circulate to officials.
- Aug 2027: Tablet‑factory raid (children’s tour) becomes national coverage; described as the third raid.
- Fall 2027: Post‑raid momentum and institutional repositioning.
- Dec 2027: Tim detained; late‑year protocol anecdotes surface publicly.
- Feb 2028: Congressional closed sessions; winter references; Georgia uses the protocol.
- Jan–Jun 2028: Agencies push DEA scheduling (Jan target); WHO framework update slated for June.

Relative/Seasonal Anchors
- “Eight months before the raid” (places Sherry’s enlightenment ≈ Dec 2026): revised_scenes/ch02_s01.md:1, scenes/ch25_s01.md:18
- “Third raid” TV segment (orders earlier raids before tablet‑factory): full_manuscript.md:2139, full_manuscript.md:2127

- Winter wind “two months since December 2027” (≈ Feb 2028): scenes/ch40_s03.md:16, full_manuscript.md:3341

Raid Sequence (ordered)
1) Retreat center raid (established as earlier than hermitage; referenced retroactively): full_manuscript.md:1965, full_manuscript.md:1891
2) Hermitage raid (explicitly “in addition to the retreat center”): full_manuscript.md:1891
3) Tablet‑factory raid (children’s tour; later TV coverage calls it the third raid): full_manuscript.md:2127, full_manuscript.md:2139

Conference & Transcript Flow
- Conference timing and heat markers (July): full_manuscript.md:1017, full_manuscript.md:1047, full_manuscript.md:1093
- Briefing files include “video and transcript” post‑conference: scenes/ch16_s01.md:26, full_manuscript.md:1509

WHO & Regulation Milestones
- WHO “exploring updates” → formal June 2028 assembly target: full_manuscript.md:2227, scenes/ch26_s02.md:34
- DEA scheduling path with Jan 2028 filing target: scenes/ch26_s02.md:70, full_manuscript.md:2263

Consistency Notes
- Revised Ch01 is a post‑Ch24 flashback; stronger knowledge (WHO, modeling) there is consistent with later chronology.
- Early O’Hearn/Bud scenes in Ch02–Ch10 should stay rumor‑level prior to conference/article beats; current revisions align with this pacing.

Open Items (light)
- If future scenes add month‑specific markers, cross‑check against the above anchors (July 2027 conference; Aug 2027 third raid; Dec 2027 detention; Feb 2028 sessions; Jun 2028 WHO).
