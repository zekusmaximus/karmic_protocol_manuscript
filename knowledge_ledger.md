- Publicly presents protocol: full_manuscript.md:1141, full_manuscript.md:1187
- Detained Dec 2027; released by Feb 2028: scenes/ch40_s03.md:16

Zach Goodman
- Internal tech validation and cautious scaling: revised_scenes/ch02_s02.md:6
- Conference involvement (July): full_manuscript.md:1047
- Post‑raid production acceleration: full_manuscript.md:1965

Carly Rice
- Internal awareness from day one; asserts internal “100%” claim: scenes/ch09_s01.md:82
- Post‑raid operations (fall): scenes/ch28_s01.md:16

Georgia Sato

Senator Yost
- Appears in tablet‑factory coverage; public awareness of raids: full_manuscript.md:2131

Cross‑check Guidance
- Prior to July 2027 conference: keep external knowledge rumor‑level (no “100%,” no modeling, no transcript/video).
- After Aug 2027: raids can be referenced publicly; “third raid” anchors sequence.
- Domino/modeling specifics should appear ≥ Ch33.
