That night, Tim opened his apartment door to welcome Finn. He glanced at the clock; it was just past seven. The living room, filled with stacks of books and research papers, felt smaller than usual with the extra company. Finn had been at his side since the first prototype, so he knew what to expect. But tonight, Jessica, a former co-worker of Tim’s who moved up from that coffee shop to start policy work for the local state senator, was going to join them. 

Tim stood by the makeshift whiteboard leaning against the wall, his fingers brushing the dry-erase marker as he took a breath. “We went with the assumption that the ideas behind the Buddhist scriptures on enlightenment were scientific, not just religious. Luckily, centuries of work had been done secularizing those texts to strip away the layers of cultural and religious interpretations. Take the term ‘enlightenment,’ for example.” 

“Nirvana,” Jessica blurted, shifting restlessly.  

“Exactly,” Tim said, a hint of a smile forming. “Can I give you a quick lecture, to help explain? There are countless interpretations of what that term means, shaped by local beliefs and customs from the time of the Buddha and those who followed. But scientifically, in modern language, what does it really mean?” He paused, letting the question hang in the air. “We needed to define what we were asking our program to help us achieve, or so we thought. The truth was, none of us knew from firsthand experience what that state of mind looked like. There was no definitive brain scan that could guide us, no map to enlightenment. We were navigating blind.” 

Jessica tilted her head, a spark of intrigue lighting her expression. “So, what did you do?” she asked, her voice soft but eager. 

Tim’s mouth tightened with a blend of pride and uncertainty, recalling those early days. “We approached the problem differently. Instead of trying to define enlightenment, we focused on the steps to get there. Ancient Buddhist texts provide detailed meditation instructions that supposedly lead to enlightenment. So we programmed those instructions into our AI system. The AI guides users through these meditation practices in virtual reality. Our hope was simple: if someone completes all the prescribed steps in VR, they’d achieve what the texts promised—enlightenment—even though we couldn’t scientifically define what enlightenment actually is.” 

The room fell silent as Tim’s words settled over them. He glanced at Jessica, noting the way her fingers absently traced the seam of the couch, her mind clearly racing with thoughts. She sat back; eyes fixed on the whiteboard as if searching for the missing pieces. 

“Ah,” Jessica said, the word drawn-out as if she understood, though Tim could tell from the confused furrow in her brow that she didn’t. Finn looked on knowingly, having worked through these problems with Tim and the others in the Protocol’s development. 

Tim leaned back slightly, drawing a deep breath to steady himself before explaining further. “Let’s put it this way,” he said. Throughout your life, you build up mental patterns that shape how you see everything. The VR program unravels these patterns one by one, showing you that what you thought was real, your thoughts, feelings, and even what your senses tell you, are actually just illusions. 

He paused, catching Jessica’s eyes, which were now wide with interest. “It’s one thing to read or be told that these things are empty of independent existence, to think you understand it in theory. But it’s another to truly experience and internalize it at the most fundamental level.” 

Jessica leaned forward, a question on her lips. “How exactly does this protocol work?” 

Tim’s lips curled into a subtle smile as he straightened his posture, chest expanding slightly. His fingers tapped a quick, eager rhythm against his thigh while his eyes remained fixed on the door, waiting. He nodded slightly. “Great question. The AI acts as a guide that adapts to each user’s unique brain activity. It’s like having a personal meditation coach that learns from your patterns and adjusts its methods as you progress. It fine-tunes its guidance as you move deeper into awareness, similar to how a meditation teacher might customize their lessons based on a student’s development.” 

Jessica’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully, a crease forming on her brow. “You mean it actually changes the brain’s structure and function?” 

Tim met her gaze and nodded. “Precisely. The protocol doesn’t ‘zap’ the brain. It helps guide users through mental patterns, like a meditation teacher would.” He paused for a moment, searching for the right metaphor and settling on one that had resonated with others before. “Think of it as a GPS for the mind. It maps out your mental roads and helps you navigate through the patterns you’ve been conditioned to follow, guiding you to your destination. It doesn’t change your mind; it shows you how to find the way on your own terms.” 

Tim watched as Jessica’s fingers tapped lightly against her knee, her mind clearly processing what he had said. The quiet hum of thought in the room was nearly tangible, and he allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. This was the beginning of understanding. 

“So, it’s like… an algorithm to enlightenment?” she asked, her voice tinged with a mix of curiosity and skepticism. 

Tim nodded, liking the ring to her statement. “Exactly. It guides users step-by-step, like a teacher, only faster. The practical benefit is that it helps people break free from destructive thought patterns that cause real suffering. Users report reduced anxiety, clearer decision-making, and more meaningful relationships within weeks, not the years or decades traditional practices might take.” 

Her brow furrowed again, doubt crossing her face. “Wait. Aren’t you tied to the results of your bad karma? The program lets you escape the consequences of your actions?” 

Tim met her eyes, his expression firm. “No, that would be impossible,” he said, his voice steady, carrying the weight of countless conversations like this one. “Externally, your actions have already set into motion the energy needed to create their consequences. This isn’t about erasing what’s been done. What the protocol does is address the problem at its root. Take, for instance, the damage you might have done to yourself through unhealthy habits. You’ll still face the physical repercussions, but your future reactions to that pain will be skillful, preventing further karma from being created. A smoker’s lungs would not be miraculously cured, but the craving to smoke would be rooted out. It all happens at the deepest level of awareness.” 

He noticed Jessica’s eyes widen slightly, gears of comprehension turning. “Fascinating. So, by stripping away this illusion of a separate self, the protocol allows people to directly experience reality in a new way?” she asked curiously. 

“Exactly,” Tim nodded, the resonance of her understanding reaching him. “The goal is to provide an unfiltered, firsthand grasp of the impermanence and interdependence of your thoughts, emotions and senses. It’s a profound shift in how you perceive everything.” 

A pause settled over the room, heavy with contemplation. Tim’s gaze drifted to Finn, who leaned forward, his eyes lit with a familiarity. Finn cleared his throat and spoke up, his voice carrying a practiced calm. “When I practiced insight meditation, I would scan my body for sensations, training myself little by little to stop identifying with them. Like when my knee ached from sitting too long. My brain would immediately label that pain as mine, sparking aversion and breaking my concentration, forcing me to shift and disrupt my focus. But eventually, I learned to just be aware of the pain, detached from it. It wasn’t mine; it wasn’t inherently good or bad. It simply existed. That allowed me to continue moving my awareness elsewhere, down to my toes or up to my head, without losing my composure.” 

Tim listened, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. Finn’s explanation captured what he had spent so long trying to convey, and for a moment, the room felt unified in shared understanding. 

“The next realization was that the pain itself had no inherent existence,” Finn continued, his words tumbled out faster as he spoke, eyes widening. He leaned forward, the pitch of his voice climbed higher on key phrases, and he barely paused for breath between sentences. Tim’s eyes flicked to Finn, appreciating how he brought energy into the room. “Imagine that. It would arise and disappear depending on conditions that were set long before I even sat down to meditate.” 

Tim nodded, the connection between their thoughts seamless. “Exactly. So, if you’d hurt your leg as a child, the protocol wouldn’t heal the old wound, but it would help you fundamentally change your understanding and reaction to similar pain in the future” Tim said, his tone softening with emphasis. “Enlightenment isn’t about becoming immune to pain or joy but being truly aware of them and recognizing their true nature.” 

Finn leaned in, eyes glinting. “Yes, and don’t forget, joy can be just as distracting as pain. It’s just as empty, just as fleeting.” 

Tim glanced at Jessica, seeing the flicker of understanding on her face. He took a breath and continued, “Which brings us to a challenge the Buddha himself pointed out in his time. It’s a challenge just as relevant now, if not more so. This truth is subtle, deep, and difficult to fully grasp, while his generation, and ours, revels in sensory pleasures.” 

Finn raised an eyebrow. “And that was before television, commercials, the internet and virtual reality.” 

Tim allowed a small chuckle to escape. Jessica’s expression grew contemplative, and she finally spoke, “We have no chance of internalizing this without the protocol.” 

Tim’s smile faded, replaced by a thoughtful look. “Probably not,” he admitted, a hint of weariness seeping into his voice. “Although, throughout the centuries, who knows how many reached enlightenment and, out of sheer frustration, chose not to teach what they discovered.” He paused, looking from face-to-face, sensing the shared curiosity. “But now, with the science and technology humanity has built over millennia in our quest for worldly pleasures, each of us has a chance, if we’re willing, to awaken. To live the remainder of our lives free from suffering.” 

The silence that followed was almost reverent, Jessica absorbing Tim’s words in her own way. The weight of possibility hung in the room, and for a moment, Tim perceived the quiet hum of hope, a small, persistent note that resonated through them all.
