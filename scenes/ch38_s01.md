“Inadequate to deal with the speed at which the technology seems to be evolving.” The speaker’s words filtered into Lawrence Cray’s consciousness, half-heard as he sifted through the report in front of him. The interview played on, a constant, annoying background reminder of the public’s ignorance. He snapped the ‘Project Roundup’ folder shut, his fingers tapping it once before he sighed. 

The arguments made against his proposal felt familiar, even predictable. His fellow bureaucrats kept citing history, invoking the darkest comparisons. Cray’s jaw clenched. They didn’t grasp the reality of the situation—these people were compromised, infected in a way that demanded intervention. Deprogramming was the bare minimum. 

To keep panic at bay, officials had insisted on the mantra that human-to-human transmission was impossible. Cray scoffed inwardly. The pacification they observed in the infected was enough for him to believe otherwise. The only way forward was containment, studying each case, and finding a solution before it spiraled out of control. 

Resistance had come from unexpected quarters. He recalled the shock of facing nearly as much opposition to the notion of a cure as to rounding up the infected. Journalists reporting on the good protocol victims were doing. It was maddening. If they refused to see the victims for what they were, casualties of a twisted protocol, then what reason did they have to fear it? 

Cray’s thoughts shifted, gratitude welling up for Gwen Trout and her relentless research. Without her findings, the push for criminalization might have faltered. The precedent was there, darker than any measures he’d put forward, to justify stopping the spread before it was too late. 

With one last look at the folder, he tossed it into the waste bin. A flash of discouragement swept over him but quickly ebbed. Vindication had come, and with it, more work to be done. Public opinion could be left to O’Hearn and his cohorts; Cray’s team was here to carry out the necessary, unglamorous tasks. 

Support wasn’t limited to domestic circles either. His mind ticked over his recent alliances, foreign actors with fewer qualms and more urgency than the methodical World Health Organization. He glanced at his calendar, confirming the upcoming meeting with Vatican security. A smile tugged at his lips as he remembered the reverend’s outrage at being excluded from the gathering. 

Cray could already predict the Vatican’s stance: an impassioned warning about the protocol’s threat to their sovereignty and legitimacy, and a plea for his government’s assistance. They didn’t need to worry about convincing him. This was a battle they could fight together, each side offering what the other lacked. 

Cray opened the file Gile had sent him on the Mulvaney interrogation, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the contents. Video clips were embedded throughout, each one more damning than the last. He clicked on a few and let them play, a low frustration simmering inside him. Evidence like this would be explosive in the upcoming congressional inquiry, but he knew better than to suggest it. The moment those recordings were scrutinized, so would the methods Homeland Security used to obtain them. The last thing he needed was to shift the spotlight onto himself. No, there was already enough ammunition without inviting chaos. 

But the Vatican could use these. Cray slipped on his earpiece and fast-forwarded through the footage, pausing at the most incriminating segments. Mulvaney’s demeanor was chilling. He wasn’t a fanatic denouncing religion, capitalism or democracy; he simply didn’t care. The danger he had unleashed was just collateral damage to his so-called vision, an existential threat to institutions Cray valued. 

Cray’s brows knitted as the video revealed Mulvaney’s detached commentary. The man displayed equal indifference toward the exiled Tibetan government, the Catholic Church, and the Pope himself. Whether it was socialism, dictatorship, or democracy, Mulvaney dismissed them all with the same nonchalance. From everything he could tell, what mattered to him was the freedom for people to “escape suffering” through his twisted experiment. 

Cray’s fingers tightened around the edge of his desk as he stopped the video. How could anyone be so self-deluded, so utterly blind? And the most glaring revelation of all, Mulvaney hadn’t undergone the protocol himself. To Cray, it was the hallmark of a hypocrite, a leader who urged others to drink the poison while keeping his own cup dry. The man wasn’t just dangerous; he was a coward. 

With a sharp inhale, Cray shifted his attention to his inbox, scrolling for updates on Georgia Sato. She’d vanished from public view after the protocol’s release. Common sense suggested he let her be, but that wasn’t Cray’s way. She needed to be held accountable, not just for financing the manufacturing but for possibly even spreading the protocol further. His eyes darkened with determination. Whatever she was plotting, he would find out and make her pay. 

Cray had entrusted Gile with the mission of tracking down Georgia Sato and bringing her in. Their success with Mulvaney had proven their capability, and he trusted they would manage this as well. Sato couldn’t stay hidden forever. Someone like her, with sprawling business interests, would inevitably leave a trace, a signature on a document or an appearance in a boardroom. They’d find her; it was only a matter of time. 

After scanning his messages and finding no updates, Cray’s mind shifted. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small key, the cold metal grounding him for a moment. Rising from his chair, he pressed against the edge of a painting on the wall. It popped forward, revealing a hidden safe, a precaution he had insisted upon when he first stepped into the role of Under Secretary. Over the years, countless sensitive documents had found temporary refuge within its walls. 

With practiced precision, Cray placed his thumb on the biometric scanner. The safe clicked softly, prompting a sequence: a retinal scan, followed by the rhythmic tapping of a sixteen-digit passcode, and finally, the insertion of the key. The process was methodical, a ritual of security that both reassured and reminded him of the stakes. 

A low chime signaled success, and the safe door eased open. Nestled inside was a sleek black virtual reality headset, its surface gleaming under the dim office light. The letters KP were etched on its side, a subtle mark of significance that sent a ripple of tension through him. 

“So much chaos caused by such a little device,” he muttered, shaking his head.
