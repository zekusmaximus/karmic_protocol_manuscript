In the car, Gile gripped the steering wheel, staring out the window. The city blurred by, an indifferent backdrop to their thoughts. She rang her partner. 

“What do we put in the report?” he finally asked after getting filled in, his voice low. 

“That Torres was uncooperative,” Gile replied, the words sharp and practiced. “No actionable intelligence.” 

A brief moment of silence finally ended when he asked. “And the sister?” 

Gile started the engine, jaw set. “What sister? That conversation didn’t happen.” 

Gile could sense the unspoken agreement, the silent understanding between them. It was a risk, an omission that could come back to haunt them. Cray would still demand answers, still press them to find Sato so they could dismantle the protocol’s spread. But for now, this was all they could offer: a moment of quiet defiance in a storm of expectations. 

As she pulled away from the curb, her partner’s voice broke the silence. “We could probably justify scaling back surveillance on the tech sector. Say resources are better spent elsewhere.” 

Gile’s grip on the wheel relaxed, ever so slightly. “Could do. Lot of other cases need attention.” 

It wasn’t redemption. Not even resistance, not really. But as she drove back to report another dead end, a subtle shift settled in. Not enlightenment, Gile knew she wasn’t anywhere close to that. But after hearing the story of Torres’ sister, maybe, just maybe, the first glimmer of doubt.
