The intercom buzzed, pulling him from his spiral of thoughts. He glanced at it, realizing he’d been lost in his own mind again. 

“Yes?” he said after shaking off the haze and pressing the button. Director Trout was here to see him. Good. “Show her in.” 

Gwen Trout always dressed impeccably, always exuded professionalism, and today was no different. She entered the room alone, a file tucked under her right arm and her phone in hand. Pulling out a chair, she sat without waiting for an invitation, placing the file on her lap and tapping it with her phone. 

“What have you got there, Director?” Cray asked, letting his gaze drop after holding eye contact as she walked in and settled into her seat. 

“Good news,” she replied, allowing a small smile to flicker at the corners of her lips for the briefest moment. 

“We need some,” Cray responded, standing and moving around his desk to pull out another chair closer to her. 

“I think we have enough from our test subject to present to the administration.” 

They had been probing one of the protocol victims for some time, their findings yielding mixed or inconclusive results. 

“Enough what?” Cray asked, his eyebrows lifting as he couldn’t help but show his interest. 

“Evidence of significant changes to the brain,” Trout answered, allowing the information to settle before continued, “beyond what our team can attribute to anything other than the protocol treatment.” 

“Damage? Dementia? Tumors? Inflammation?” Cray fired off questions, his agitation barely masking the excitement that threatened to surface. 

“Not exactly,” Trout said, opening the file and leafing through its pages until she found what she was searching for. 

“Please tell me it’s meningitis, encephalitis,” he said, leaning in and squinting at the document, “Gehrig’s disease!” 

“No, nothing like that,” she replied. “Neurogenesis, heightened plasticity, increased signaling entropy, hypo-connectivity in several regions, all sustained and off the charts.” 

Damn, Cray thought. He didn’t fully understand the implications, but none of it sounded catastrophic. “No damage?” he pressed. 

“No,” Trout confirmed. “No damage, but we have no way of knowing how long the human brain can maintain these activities or what the long-term effects could be. The point is, we have enough significant change from baseline readings of non-protocol users to argue for a temporary moratorium, and if we frame it right, maybe even push for criminalization.” 

There it was, the breakthrough he’d been waiting for. Cray clapped his hands together with a sharp smack and stood up. 

“Gwen, I knew there was a reason I liked you,” he said, turning to stride back to his desk. When he glanced back, he noticed a faint smile on her lips, though there was a subtle coolness in her eyes that suggested the feeling might not be entirely mutual. No matter. They had what they needed. “Let’s get this framed properly. I’ll handle my end.” 

Trout nodded, closing the file and standing. “Lawrence, this isn’t going to stop the spread.” 

“It’ll buy us the time and leverage we need to stop the people behind it.” He reached for the intercom, his finger pressing the button as he instructed his aide to connect him with the Secretary.
