Lawrence Cray had never felt closer to having an honest-to-God aneurysm than on the day his boss, the Secretary of Homeland Security, dropped by his office unannounced to show him the karmic protocol headset that had been delivered to the Department that morning. The memory of that moment still boiled in his veins, the kind of anger so intense he could almost see a red haze creeping at the edges of his vision. The old saying about seeing red, he realized, was rooted in more than just exaggeration. 

He’d been reliving that seething anger repeatedly over the past week as the full scale of the dissemination became clear. There had been a pattern, an infuriating logic, behind the deliveries. For every headset reported and confiscated, Cray knew several more were being hidden or used beyond their reach. 

Reports began trickling in, scattered anecdotes of individuals using the headsets. While there hadn’t been any signs of a coordinated effort to bring people through the protocol like the one at the retreat center, Cray was acutely aware that it was only a matter of time. The strategy behind the distribution had been flawless, over five hundred units dispatched within a tightly orchestrated 48-hour window. Packages had reached religious institutions, meditation centers, and carefully chosen private individuals all at once. By the time anyone understood the scale, it was too late to intercept more than a fraction. The decentralized nature of the distribution only made containment more difficult; there was no singular entity to shut down or slap with a cease-and-desist. 

The unlicensed medical device classification was useful, enabling them to seize units when found, but Cray knew it wasn’t enough. What they needed was legislation banning possession, usage or facilitation of the protocol. He scoffed at the thought; it would take a catastrophe to push Congress into passing that kind of law. Arresting every person who’d interacted with a headset was a fantasy they couldn’t indulge. 

This disaster could have been prevented. If Henning and most of the administration hadn’t been so cowardly. If they’d allocated the same resources to him that other Under Secretaries had at the Department. If they had let him engage the media when Sato and Rice were out there reassuring the public that the protocol was too benign to worry about. 

At least Cray had Frank O’Hearn to thank. Frank had mobilized the chambers of commerce, evangelicals, and, most critically, the big financial players. The media was finally shifting in their favor. Businesses, religious groups, and even politicians were starting to comprehend the implications. Meanwhile, the other side found themselves without a spokesperson to counter the momentum. 

Sato hadn’t given a single interview since the story broke, and Carly Rice was presumably meditating somewhere in the woods. Cray couldn’t shake the feeling that those who had been brainwashed by the technology were no longer interested in spreading the word about it. Meanwhile, Goodman was back under surveillance, and his agents kept insisting they were closing in on Mulvaney, though Cray had his doubts.
