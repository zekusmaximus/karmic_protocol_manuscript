Later, alone in a nearby meditation room, Tim sat cross-legged amidst code printouts and circuit diagrams. He ran his thumb along his brother’s worn meditation beads, the smooth wood familiar beneath his touch.  

A soft flutter of wings drew his gaze to the window. A bird had landed on the sill, tilting its head in an almost comical curiosity. Tim watched it, allowing himself a brief pause. He knew he wasn’t ready for enlightenment himself, not while there was still so much to do. But a faint stir of memory whispered in the back of his mind. Bud Turner. Apparently, he hadn’t used the protocol. What would it take for someone like? To see what it truly offered? A smirk crept across Tim’s face.  

The door creaked, and Tim looked up as Georgia Sato stepped inside. 

“I’ve been thinking about Bud Turner,” he said, the thought escaping before he could reconsider. 

“Tell me about him,” Georgia replied, settling into a chair nearby, her attention sharp and unwavering. 

Tim’s fingers drummed on the floor, echoing his restless thoughts. “He was the corporate lobbyist who organized the conference where I first revealed the protocol. He had influence on both the corporate and government fronts.” He glanced at Georgia, seeking her reaction but finding only patient curiosity. “He could’ve tried to shut us down completely, but he didn’t. Instead, he stepped back. I left a headset with him, thought he might be ready.” 

“What made you think that?” Georgia’s tone was gentle, inviting more. 

“I don’t know.” Tim’s gaze fell to the diagrams at his feet. “Perhaps I rushed it. He’s still tied to their world.” 

Georgia nodded, her silence more eloquent than words. She had a way of listening that coaxed out the hidden layers of truth. 

“The thing is,” Tim continued, almost to himself, “he saw something in the protocol. Even if he denies it.” 

“Interesting,” Georgia said, her voice contemplative. She stood, pausing at the door. “Sometimes understanding comes in unexpected ways.” 

Tim’s eyes returned to his papers as Georgia left, her quiet smile unnoticed. The room settled into silence, but the flicker of doubt remained. Not everyone was ready. Not everyone could take that leap. Tim let out a breath, a rueful smile touching his lips. The protocol could open doors, but what people found on the other side would be their journey alone.
