Standing up, Gile decided she needed space. Her partner didn’t need to see this play out. She walked briskly down the hall, away from the watchful eyes of the task force, and dialed the number. 

Jessica’s voice answered on the first ring. “Agent Gile, thanks for calling me back.” 

“Of course, but I’m not sure what I can help with. Anything official should go through Cray’s office,” Gile replied, forcing an even tone. She could hear the edge in her own voice, betraying the weariness that had crept in over weeks of dead-end searches. 

“Oh, nothing official, just a couple of background issues,” Jessica said, her voice lowering slightly, like she was leaning in. “The Senator is trying to wrap his head around this thing, and I figured I’d go to the source and see if you had any insight we couldn’t get through…uh…proper channels.” 

Gile’s fingers tightened around the phone. “I’m just a field agent, as you know, but I’ll try to be of help.” 

“Well, first off, and this is a long shot,” Jessica said, dropping her voice further, “we have a short list of constituents we’ve lost contact with since this whole thing blew up. I know it’s all confidential, high-level stuff, but…” 

“Who?” Gile cut in, a thread of tension winding tighter. 

“Georgia Sato, for one,” Jessica said. “We tried to contact her about the hearing and have spent weeks trying to locate her, which seems odd.” 

A cold realization settled over Gile. Pointless. This phone call wasn’t going to give her any new leads. “I must admit, it’s odd to us as well that, right after these headsets were distributed, the person we believed to be involved in their manufacture goes missing.” 

“So, you’re looking for her too?” 

Gile kept her response measured. “We are looking for several people we’d like to interview in relation to the case, and yes, Georgia Sato is one of those people.” 

Unfortunately, Gile couldn’t offer much. “I can’t help you; we haven’t been able to contact her for an interview. To be honest, I was hoping your office might have some information.” 

“I wish we did,” Jessica replied, her voice carrying an undertone of genuine regret. “How about Tim Mulvaney?” 

Gile stiffened, letting the question hang in the silence. How did Yost’s office even know who Mulvaney was? She cleared her throat, keeping her tone controlled. “What is the Senator’s interest in Mulvaney?” 

“As I mentioned, we have a few constituents unaccounted for. Mulvaney made that speech about the protocol at the industry conference. He keeps an apartment in the district, and we were trying to reach him for the testimony. Has Homeland Security managed to,” Jessica’s voice dropped a note, “interview him?” 

“No, no,” Gile said, her reply coming out a beat too fast. “Homeland Security hasn’t interviewed Mr. Mulvaney.” 

“But you know where he is,” Jessica pressed, more statement than question. 

Gile’s pulse quickened. This line of questioning was venturing into dangerous territory. If Yost’s office had gotten wind of Trout’s maneuvers at the FDA, it could complicate things further. 

“I don’t,” Gile said, which, for now, was true enough. Mulvaney hadn’t been released, but where he was, or which agency had him now was unclear. Trout planned to hand him over to the FBI, but that was where her knowledge ended. 

“There are a few more names on our list,” Jessica continued, seeming to ease off, “but I’d rather not put anything in writing. What I really need to know is if you can share any off-the-record information about where these headsets were manufactured. Did the Administration track down the real facility?” 

“Off the record,” Gile said, lowering her voice slightly, “we did. The facility wasn’t tied to Sato, and it was abandoned by the time we got there.” 

“Was it in our district? And were there any arrests?” Jessica asked. “We managed to reach Carly Rice, but she didn’t know anything significant.” 

“Location isn’t important since it wasn’t technically illegal when it happened. There have been no arrests, no warrants,” Gile said, the fatigue pressing into her words. “Unless someone starts manufacturing these headsets again, that’s how it will probably stay. And yes, we share your view about Rice.” 

“Thanks, Agent Gile,” Jessica said. “One last question. Homeland Security is going to support the permanent criminalization of the protocol at the hearing, correct?” 

“That’s way above my pay grade,” Gile replied, knowing full well nothing could keep Cray from testifying. “To my knowledge, Homeland Security is leaving the testimony to the FDA scientists and the World Health Organization.” 

“Probably for the best,” Jessica said before the line clicked dead. 

Gile pocketed her phone, the conversation looping in her head. Why was Yost’s office so keen on Sato and Mulvaney? The possibility of the Senator being involved was unsettling, but it didn’t matter now. Sato was the last lead.  

She stepped back into the office, the hum of keyboards and muted chatter greeting her. Her partner looked up, eyes curious. “Any luck?” 

“No,” she said, her voice clipped. “Do you know what they’ve done with Mulvaney?” 

He shrugged. “Don’t know, don’t care.” 

“Same here,” Gile muttered. If she ever saw him again, it would be too soon. They shared a brief, humorless laugh before diving back into their work.
