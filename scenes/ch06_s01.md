The next day, Zach stepped into the office of the retreat building, taking in the familiar scent of aged wood and herbs that always lingered in the air. The building marked the entrance to Jeta’s Grove, set apart from the cluster of hermitage buildings hidden deeper within the forest. 

Carly sat at her desk, absorbed in paperwork.  

“Got a minute?” Zach asked, lowering himself into a chair opposite her. 

“For you, I’ve got a few,” she said with a warm smile, closing the folder she’d been reviewing. 

He hesitated. “A couple of things. First, I got an unexpected invitation to give a presentation on the regulation of virtual reality platforms at a conference for legislators.” 

She raised an eyebrow, mildly curious. “I can’t say that’s surprising, considering your field.” 

“True,” he admitted, shifting his weight slightly. “But it’s the focus that caught me off guard, the potential for government bodies to ban this technology. It felt… oddly specific.” 

Carly’s eyes widened, her fingers pausing mid-tap on the desk. “Oddly specific indeed. Plenty of our recruits are or were involved in your industry, so it’s possible someone’s been talking. Oh, and by the way, Modern Meditator Magazine called. They want to write a piece about the protocol. Could there be a connection?” 

A faint flush crept up Zach’s neck, an old tell of his when embarrassment struck. “Modern Meditator? How would they even know? Maybe I let something slip during those early trials and recruitment phases.” 

“I wouldn’t worry too much,” Carly said, her voice soft but steady. “So, you mentioned you were invited to speak, did you accept?” 

He glanced at his hands, the question gnawing at him. “I wasn’t planning to, but now I’m thinking that turning it down might draw more attention than just going through with it. Especially if there’s already potential press coverage,” he said, letting the end of his sentence hang, almost as a question. 

If she caught the hesitation, Carly didn’t acknowledge it. Instead, she shifted gears. “You mentioned there was something else?” 

Zach’s jaw tightened, a flicker of concern passing through his eyes. “The usual security,” he said. “We need something as basic as a sign-in sheet for the work area downstairs. The more we progress and the more hints we get that people outside know about it, the more on edge I feel.” 

“What exactly has you on edge?” Carly asked. 

He exhaled,. “We’ve built a solid framework, thanks to Tim, Sarah, and the rest of the team. The way we’re rolling this out, cautiously, with deliberate steps, feels right. But the idea of the tech or the programming slipping off campus, even unintentionally… that’s what keeps me up at night.” 

“Zach, you know I share these concerns,” Carly said, leaning forward over the desk, her expression softening into that almost maternal look she sometimes wore. The shift made him feel both comforted and exposed. “But this is a meditation retreat, not a top-secret lab. We’ve kept traffic to the protocol areas minimal, and I trust the intentions of everyone involved in this project.” 

“Me too, me too,” Zach said, though the words felt hollow. As he tried to give shape to his fears, they felt increasingly absurd, like shadows stretching too far. He shook his head slightly, clearing his thoughts. “I’m more than nervous, Carly. I’m scared.” 

The seriousness in his voice made Carly pause. She stood and came around to sit on the front edge of the desk, so close now that Zach could see the slight lines of worry around her eyes. “What are you scared of?” she asked, leaning in. 

He swallowed, feeling the dry tightness in his throat. “I’m scared someone will share the protocol prematurely, for the wrong reasons. I’m scared the world isn’t ready for this.” 

She closed her eyes for a moment, then met his gaze. “Look, I get it. But honestly, Zach, when would the world ever be ready for something like this?” 

“That’s not…” Zach raked a hand through his hair. “We built this thing, Carly. Us. Don’t we owe it to everyone to make sure they’re prepared before it gets out there?” The words tumbled out, his voice rising. “Before someone gets hurt?” 

Carly’s mouth curved into a faint smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “Zach, the protocol assists with enlightenment. It isn’t an incurable virus.” 

“To us, it isn’t,” he countered. His heartbeat drummed harder. “Everyone here, everyone who worked on it, who programmed and tested it, we all understand it. Enlightenment is a goal we share. But outside this retreat? To people at the local coffee shop, or sitting in church pews, or debating in legislative chambers, it could be seen as a threat. Maybe even worse.” He felt the chill ripple across his skin, leaving goosebumps in its wake. 

Carly’s eyes widened for a moment as she took in his expression, truly seeing how unsettled he was. She took a steadying breath before speaking, her tone softer. “We need to take this seriously, Zach. I admit we’ve skirted this issue for too long. While most have exercised caution, some have pushed for broader, faster deployment. I’ll talk to Tim, Sherry, and some of the others to reassess our approach. We’ll consider more discretion and look at bolstering security for the headsets and data.” 

Relief washed over him, loosening the tight bands of anxiety around his chest. Zach stood, letting out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding, and bowed slightly. “Thank you, Carly. That’s all I ask, you’re the leader here, people will listen if it comes from you” 

“Anytime,” she said, matching his bow with a hint of a smile. “And Zach?” 

He paused, hand still hovering over the back of his chair. “Yes?” 

“Consider the presentation. It could help the world get ready.”
