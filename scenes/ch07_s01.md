It was late in the evening when Georgia finally bid farewell to the group at Jeta’s Grove and began her drive home. The car chose a route and moved smoothly out of the driveway. After spending a few days at the retreat, she felt a deep sense of renewal, a wave of contentment settling over her. 

Her thoughts drifted, as they often did in these moments. She pondered undergoing the protocol herself. What would it mean to step back from her businesses and to hand over their day-to-day operations to trusted associates? Then embrace a simpler existence steeped in meditation. The idea of staying at Jeta’s Grove, learning from Ed and the others, tugged at her mind. 

A familiar resistance stirred within her. Some ingrained drive she couldn’t quite name, kept pulling her back to her responsibilities. Managing her interests and occupying her place on various boards gave her satisfaction she couldn’t deny. Even the stress, the moments of anxiety, had become oddly reassuring, a sign of her continued relevance. 

The protocol felt like her only chance to untangle the knots she’d allowed to tighten in her life’s fabric. A year ago, the thought wouldn’t have crossed her mind. Back then, if someone had asked where she saw herself in five or ten years, she would have spoken in terms of achievements, status and power. Now, however, she felt a certainty she couldn’t shake: she would reach enlightenment within that timeframe, or sooner. 

But the path wasn’t straightforward. Carly’s painstakingly slow and cautious approach to the protocol frustrated her. Her wealth and influence had proven useless in advancing her position on the waiting list. She’d gathered substantial insight into how the center managed this groundbreaking process. Deliberate and meticulous, they permitted only candidates deemed ready, those already detached from worldly attachments, to proceed. 

Ed’s face surfaced in her mind, he had been an ideal participant. Retired, rooted in the serenity of the retreat, with no family to tie him down. Georgia considered the others who had undergone the protocol and had a sudden flash of understanding. Were they selecting only those certain to succeed? Could the protocol work for someone like her, tangled in desires, attachments and the complexities of the material world? Would it penetrate the dense layers of karma she had accumulated, even just in this lifetime? 

A sigh escaped her lips. She was far from saintly, and she knew it. In a world as unforgiving as this one, purity seemed almost impossible. Generosity was part of her nature, but so was shrewdness, a sharpness honed by years in business. The idea that using her success as a financier to meaningfully alleviate suffering through charity, ethical practices, it felt hollow. She did what she could to minimize harm, balancing her actions with prayer and meditation, yet the question remained: how could she genuinely help anyone else when she herself was so deeply ensnared in the very suffering she wished to transcend?

Tomorrow, she was meeting with Tim at her office.  

A flicker of curiosity surfaced as she wondered why Tim had chosen her office for their meeting rather than one of the quiet nooks at Jeta’s Grove. Was he on the cusp of undergoing the protocol himself? Or, she dared to hope, was he about to tell her that she would finally have a chance at it? Whatever the reason, it was a perfect opportunity to seek his insight into her own reflections and questions.
