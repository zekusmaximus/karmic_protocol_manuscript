The sound of Finn’s laughter floated over as they prepped the units for shipment. Curious, Zach moved closer, catching snippets of their conversation. 

“Every member of Congress and world leader should get one,” Finn declared, his voice full of conviction. 

He let out a chuckle, adjusting a stack of boxed units as he continued. “The priority is to get them into the hands of people likely to use them, but I like your thinking!” 

Zach stepped in, his voice cutting through the banter. “Remember, many of those types, if they’ve heard about it at all, still see the protocol as a threat.” 

Finn turned at the sound of his voice, his surprise giving way to acknowledgment. 

“They’ll hear about it soon enough!” He responded, sealing a package with a firm slap of the label. 

Tim grinned, eyes bright. “Yeah, they can only run so long from the inevitability of enlightenment.” 

Zach nodded, but the weight of experience tempered his expression. “I don’t disagree,” he said, his tone measured. “But as we’ve seen firsthand, there are going to be growing pains along the way. Let’s try to ease them, not make them worse, if we can.” 

Finn raised an eyebrow, a spark of defiance playing across his face. “Sometimes it’s easier just to rip the band-aid off,” he quipped, earning a knowing glance from Tim. 

Zach’s mouth curved into a half-smile. “You usually wait for the bleeding to stop before you do that, Finn,” he said, a trace of humor softening his words as he looked between them. 

After three months of meticulous production and strategic stockpiling, they were finally ready. Zach felt a pulse of anticipation as he took in the scene, the organized chaos of the facility buzzing with purpose. The first couple thousand protocols would soon be distributed across multiple locations around the world simultaneously, ensuring that containment would be impossible. 

Tim stood nearby, studying the shipping manifests in his hands. Over a thousand units were prepared for deployment. Zach noted the way Tim’s fingers brushed over one of the sleek black headsets, a rare softness crossing his usually composed face. 

“It took longer than we wanted,” Tim murmured, his voice thoughtful, “but the wait was worth it.” He paused, almost to himself, before added, “Sometimes the dharma moves slowly, but it moves with purpose. Arguing over a distribution list we’ve already finalized won’t make them ship any faster. Those who seek these out will find them, once we’ve gotten them out to the retreat centers, monasteries and other likely places.” 

Zach observed Tim closely, a familiar curiosity stirring within him. Over time, he’d grown to respect and trust Tim’s judgment and enjoyed their late-night talks that always veered into philosophy and strategy. Yet, despite their shared history, from their time at the retreat center to working side by side in this facility, Tim remained an enigma. Zach knew the man was educated, that much was clear, but the details of his background, his upbringing, any family he might have had, all remained a mystery. 

Still, he knew some things: Tim’s favorite pizza topping, his preference for sparkling water over flat, and the fact that he was an ardent student of Buddhist scriptures, far more committed than Zach himself, who had once considered his own dedication profound. Most importantly, he knew Tim was unwavering in his advocacy for spreading the protocol, driven and focused in a way that inspired those around him. 

“Looks like the dismantling of the facility is proceeding smoothly,” Zach said, breaking the silence. 

Tim glanced up, the corners of his mouth lifting slightly. “Yes,” he replied. “We’ll be ready to go mobile in a few days. This place can go back to fabricating solar panels or whatever they were doing here before we arrived.” 

A voice from behind them interrupted, carrying a hint of sarcasm. “A shame,” Finn said, with a playful grin. “It was just starting to feel like home.” 

“It’s definitely starting to smell like your home,” Tim quipped, setting a stack of boxes onto a hand truck. The joke landed perfectly, drawing a round of laughter from the group. 

As the sound faded, Tim’s expression turned serious again. “We’ll need to lie low while this first wave hits,” he said. “After that, there’ll be other homes, I’m sure.” 

A shadow crossed Zach’s face at those words. His shoulders tensed, almost imperceptibly, as he glanced toward the window.. Lying low—what would that even mean for him? He had already decided against joining the others at Jeta’s Grove, where some of them planned to regroup. The idea of being surrounded by familiar faces but feeling out of place didn’t appeal to him. And as for Tim and his inner circle, their next destination remained a mystery to Zach. He hadn’t been invited, and he wouldn’t ask. 

The absence of a job, a role, weighed on him. He hadn’t signed up with any of the dharmapalas who would be monitoring the rollout and offering support to new users. Even if he had wanted to, he knew he was too recognizable for such assignments. His presence would draw attention, and that was the last thing they needed. 

Zach had once floated the idea of embracing his visibility, maybe even doing some press to shape the narrative, but the group’s response had been clear. It wasn’t the right time, and Tim’s voice had been the most adamant, the edge of paranoia sharp in his tone. The risk was too great, he argued, and losing their main programmer to an ill-timed rendition attempt wasn’t a chance they could take. 

Despite that, Zach didn’t feel particularly endangered anymore. The administration’s fervor had waned after their spectacular failure at the tablet factory, a blow from which they hadn’t recovered. The cease-and-desist order had been lifted, not that it mattered much now with the retreat center shuttered indefinitely. 

He toyed with the idea of stepping back completely, observing the aftermath from a quiet place. He might stay, ready to step in if production continued or an unforeseen need arose. That thought carried a certain peaceful allure, time alone to think, to reconnect. Maybe he’d even reach out to Joe Bronski, catch up over stories they’d left unfinished.
