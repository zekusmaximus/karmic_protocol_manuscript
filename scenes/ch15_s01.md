Sherry Carpenter had been the first person to go through the karmic protocol. Upon removing the virtual reality headset, she had not laughed, but simply smiled. The tinge of nervousness she had experienced just prior to starting the protocol had vanished, and for lack of a better word she felt content. 

She didn’t feel like a Buddha, nor had celestial beings appeared to her. Memories of past lives did not surge back, and nothing supernatural unfolded before her. Yet, she became acutely aware of her presence in space and time, an awareness that filled her with a profound and unshakable contentment. 

Within the familiar surroundings of Jeta’s Grove, Sherry continued additional tests related to the protocol. She reported on her progress, meditations and insights as requested. It wasn’t an obligation, it was an experience. The meditators there welcomed her presence. They sat with her, shared meals, and spoke candidly about the challenges they faced in their own practices. They never sought her guidance, and she found herself speaking less, preferring the role of a listener. 

Time with the other awakened ones brought Sherry a quiet joy. Their calm energy refreshed her, filling her days with moments that needed no embellishment. They would often retreat to rooms or wander into the surrounding woods, settling into meditation without words. Simply existing in the shared experience of the present. As more individuals went through the protocol, Sherry noticed subtle differences in their enlightenments, some felt compelled to teach, while others, like herself, sought silence and solitude. 

The day came when she felt ready to leave the retreat center. There was no announcement or farewell; she simply set off on a long walk one afternoon and did not return. Days blurred into each other as she moved through wooded paths and occasionally passed through small towns. Each place, whether vaguely familiar or completely new, unfolded in vibrant detail, as if seen for the first time through her heightened senses. The crisp crunch of leaves beneath her feet, the sharp, clear calls of birds that had always been present but previously ignored, now, she noticed them all. 

When hunger came, it felt instinctive to know which roots, flowers, seeds and berries could nourish her. Sleep became an infrequent visitor, but when she did rest, it was light, a state where awareness lingered, and dreams did not intrude. 

In her old life, Sherry had never been particularly charismatic. Those who knew her liked her well enough, but she had always been reserved. Now, however, she noticed how people were inexplicably drawn to her. When she entered a town center and settled on a park bench, it wasn’t long before passersby took note, some even stopping to greet her. She welcomed their attention, though her responses remained brief and direct, with most of the exchange conveyed without words. A glance, a smile, a wave or a nod often said more than her voice could. 

As days turned into weeks, she found herself revisiting familiar areas, becoming a familiar face at soup kitchens along her route. She accepted the simple meals they offered and always made a point to arrive early, staying behind to help with tasks that others might rush through. Washing dishes, clearing tables, and sweeping the floor had become meditative practices, tasks she would never have seen in such a light before. 

If someone offered her a place to sleep for the night, she would accept, but she never sought it out. Her quiet presence brought a sense of calm, something the staff and patrons valued, even if they couldn’t fully explain why. It was a small comfort to them, the company of someone who was at once vibrant, thoughtful, and silent. 

Sometimes, she found herself among the homeless, nestled in encampments under bridges or alongside highways. She walked and meditated with those who had been pushed there by circumstance or choice, always sensing a subtle peace in her presence. Danger never seemed to touch her; she had nothing that could inspire jealousy or theft. When tensions arose, she would step in, her smile dissolving anger, her few words or simple gestures defusing even the most volatile outbursts. She felt a deep connection to those still entangled in their suffering, and without imposing or asserting herself, she did what she could to ease their burdens. 

Living this way brought a kind of anonymity that suited her. She wasn’t the center of any gathering or the focal point of any place. Some people knew her as Sherry, but she rarely gave or asked for names. She preferred to be with others in that simple, label-free space. Her ability to understand people, to see into their hearts and minds, was uncanny, but her thoughtful brevity kept the interactions from feeling unsettling. 

Sherry’s suffering had dissolved through understanding, mental discipline and insight. She followed the middle path with ease, aiding others on their journeys, whether they realized they were on one or not. For months, she lived a life that was serene and full, surrounded by nature and those society often overlooked. She had no phone, no email, no social media, no mailing address. No debts, credit cards, bank accounts, streaming subscriptions, or loyalty cards. This absence of ties made it much harder for those searching for her to track her down. 

“Sherry Carpenter?” The voice broke the quiet rhythm of her cleaning as she wiped down the folding tables in the church basement after the lunch service. The sound of her full name startled her; it had been so long since she’d heard it. 

“Yes,” she answered, setting the cloth down gently. 

“I’m Agent Fiona Gile,” a woman in a suit continued, another suited gentleman behind her. “We’re with Homeland Security, and we were hoping to ask you some questions.”
