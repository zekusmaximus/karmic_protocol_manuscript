Bud finished his breakfast and started putting the dishes into the dishwasher. The silence of the house felt unfamiliar; his wife had taken their son for a weekend visit to her parents, leaving him alone for the first time in ages. Despite the rare full night’s sleep he’d had, an emptiness gnawed at him, he already missed his little boy. 

His eyes drifted to the list of chores taped to the refrigerator, and he sighed. Dishes, easy. Garbage, easy. Laundry, ugh. Garage loft cleanup, double ugh. Maybe going to the office for a bit would be a good excuse to delay the dreaded loft cleanup. But then, his wife’s voice echoed in his head: Just get it over with now, then it will be done. 

He pulled a sweatshirt over his head and grabbed the broom. Starting with the hardest task seemed like the least he could do to reclaim the rest of the day. The garage loft was meant to be a useful space, but it had become a dumping ground for anything they couldn’t find a place for in their rushed lives. Bud shook his head, thinking that maybe it was best to accept it as a permanent storage area.  

Resigned, he trudged toward the garage entrance, considering where he might relocate all the clutter. The doorbell rang, cutting through his thoughts and giving him a sliver of hope that it was a delivery, any excuse to not clean that garage. He set the broom down and walked to the front door, silently wishing for a mundane package. 

When he opened the door, his stomach dropped. Standing there was Georgia Sato.  

Bud had seen Georgia Sato before, images in news articles, fleeting glances during protocol working group meetings, but never in person. What could have brought her to his doorstep? He took a steadying breath before opening the door wider. “Ms. Sato,” he said, doing his best to sound composed. 

“Mr. Turner,” she responded, and the smile that followed caught him off guard. It was brilliant, sincere, and startlingly warm. For a moment, Bud’s irritation dissolved, replaced by an inexplicable draw toward her presence. He blinked, feeling the thread of his internal dialogue slip through his grasp. 

The silence between them lingered, but it felt natural, not strained. Bud struggled to collect himself, wondering why her mere presence left him so disarmed. Finally, she spoke, her voice cutting through the quiet. “May I come in?” 

Bud snapped back to himself. “Of course, of course,” he said, moving aside and gesturing with an automatic politeness. “Where are my manners?” He realized how robotic he sounded but pushed the thought away as she stepped past him, turning to face him as he closed the door. 

“To what do I owe the pleasure?” he asked, trying to regain his bearings. 

“I have come to be of service,” she said, matter-of-factly. Bud’s mind, always looking for an out, immediately conjured a humorous image of Georgia Sato hauling boxes and sweeping up dust in the garage loft. The absurdity made the corner of his mouth twitch. 

“I do have a list of chores I was about to get started on,” he blurted out, half-joking. The words felt foolish the moment they escaped, and questions he couldn’t voice gnawed at him. Why was she here? What trouble was following her to his doorstep? But he kept those thoughts locked away. None of it could come to the surface. 

Moments later, in what felt like the strangest twist in recent memory, she had agreed to help, and they were clearing out the garage loft together. Bud shifted boxes, opened bags, and straightened shelves, each task underscored by the surreal realization that Georgia Sato was helping him with his weekend chores. The absurdity of it all pressed down on him, making him shake his head as if trying to break free from a waking dream. 

Finally, as he stacked an old box and wiped his hands, he turned to her and spoke, the disbelief clear in his voice. “Georgia, why are you really here? You didn’t just come to help me with my weekend chores.” 

“No,” she said, her tone softening, “no, Freeman Turner, I did not.” 

The sound of his full name cut through him like a sharp wind. Bud felt the air shift; he pulled over a stool and sank down, his legs suddenly heavy. 

“I sense that I can be of real service to you,” she continued, “not just in organizing your living space, but in giving you back your breathing space.” 

“Did Tim send you?” he asked, a flicker of suspicion narrowing his eyes. Her cryptic words stirred unease. “Because if it’s about the protocol he dropped off here, I already gave it away.” 

A hint of amusement curved her lips. “No, Tim did not send me,” she said, her voice steady. “Why, if you don’t mind my asking, did you give it away?” 

The realization slammed into Bud like a rogue wave, sending a jolt through his chest. He stood, the stool creaking as it shifted behind him, and instinctively stepped back. She had used the protocol. The room tilted as confusion set in. He scanned the loft, suddenly hyper-aware of the strange scene: a woman he barely knew in his home, sorting through the forgotten remnants of his life as if it were the most natural thing in the world. 

“I don’t need it,” Bud said, his voice faltering. “I’m happy.” The words hung between them, heavier than he expected. Was he, though? Yes, dammit, he was. He ran through the mental inventory: a fantastic job, an even better wife, and the best son. Food, clothes, shelter, entertainment, love, each thought collided with the next, rushing to reassure him. 

“You are happy; no one could dispute that,” Georgia said, her tone calm, pulling him back from the edge of doubt. 

“Very!” Bud insisted, the declaration forcing some steadiness into his voice. “So why would I need the protocol?” 

“Indeed,” Georgia echoed, turning back to the shelf, her movements measured and unhurried. 

Bud’s gaze dropped, and a realization crept in uninvited: if he had been truly unhappy, he would have put that headset on without hesitation. The thought unsettled him. He was happy, wasn’t he? He replayed the checklist in his mind, great job, loving wife, amazing son, security, comfort, love, but it felt like he was reciting a mantra to ward off something unseen. His eyes drifted to Georgia, who moved with a simplicity that made his racing thoughts feel clumsy. She simply was. 

A shiver of unease tightened his chest. What would happen to his ambition, his drive, if he went through the protocol? Would the hunger for success, the desire for influence and power, disappear? Would he still be the man Cheryl had married, the father little George needed him to be? The questions piled up, flimsy and defensive. 

Georgia’s voice cut through his musings. “Let me ask you,” she said, pausing just long enough to hold his attention, “what are you afraid will happen if you are awakened?” 

Afraid? The word pricked at his pride. He wasn’t afraid. He just didn’t need it, didn’t want it. He needed to be here, solid and grounded, for Cheryl, for George. The image of abandoning it all to meditate in the woods, chanting “om” and savoring the breeze on his face, flashed through his mind. The idea felt both absurd and dangerously alluring. He shook his head, as if to dislodge the thought. 

She sat here, in his garage, sorting through the chaos of his life with the same precision she had once applied to managing her business empire. The only difference was the unshakeable peace she carried, a peace Bud felt a sharp pang of envy for. 

“I’m not afraid,” he said, surprising himself with the openness he offered this woman who somehow didn’t feel like a stranger. “I’m just not ready.” 

The admission caught him off guard. It wasn’t a firm “no.” It wasn’t even “never.” It was just “not ready.” When had that shift crept into his thinking? His mind darted to the protocol headset he’d given away. For the first time, regret, faint but undeniable, twisted in his chest. 

Georgia reached into her bag and, to his disbelief, pulled out a headset. “The one I used, for when you’re ready,” she said, turning it over in her hands. “The protocol doesn’t create enlightenment,” she continued, her voice calm and steady. “It’s like having a perfect meditation teacher who can see exactly what’s happening in your mind. The biofeedback system shows your brain what that state feels like, while the AI guides you toward attaining it.” 

The silence that followed wasn’t strained. Georgia’s presence carved out a space where things he normally kept buried could surface, raw and unfiltered. 

“Imagine a world where people are free from the suffering caused by their own minds,” she said, her eyes reflecting a vision that was almost palpable. “The protocol isn’t just about personal transformation, Bud. It’s about transforming society. When enough people awaken, the very fabric of our civilization will change.” 

Bud’s pulse quickened, a shiver racing up his spine. “Yes, and in the meantime everything I built my life around will crumble…” What if enlightenment wasn’t what she imagined? What if it was more than serene meditation and gentle detachment from life’s noise? A darker thought took hold: what if the protocol tore apart everything he’d built his life around, his beliefs, his carefully constructed identity, his stance on what was right and just? What if it shattered the illusion that he was one of the good guys? 

Bud’s mind flickered to the campaign he had helped orchestrate against the protocol: the falsified evidence used to frame Zach, the raids that shattered lives, the relentless stream of propaganda. He had justified it all to himself, convinced that he was protecting society. But sitting here with Georgia, those justifications felt thin, like paper crumbling under the weight of doubt. 

His eyes fell on the sleek, black headset she had handed to him. It gleamed under the muted light of the room, its polished surface catching and reflecting the glow like liquid obsidian. A faint hum resonated from it, almost like a distant, whispered tune. The air held a subtle scent of innovative technology, a mix of metal and plastic, which hinted at the intricate circuits nestled within. Bud’s fingers brushed over the cool, smooth surface, the touch igniting a blend of anticipation and unease deep in his gut. This was more than just a marvel of engineering; it felt like holding a bridge between the known and the unknowable, a key to something like enlightenment itself. 

“What if,” he began, the tremor in his voice betraying the vulnerability he felt, “what if I look inside and don’t like what I find?” 

Georgia’s expression softened, her eyes shining with a compassion that made something tighten in his chest. There was no judgment there, no pity, just a deep, unwavering understanding. “The truth,” she said gently, “doesn’t require your approval. It simply is.” 

A chill coursed through Bud. That was it, his true fear. Not that enlightenment would transform him, but that it would reveal who he already was. Every compromise, every moral corner he’d cut, every time he had chosen convenience over principle, they would all be laid bare, stripped of comforting rationalizations. Yet when he looked at Georgia, he saw none of the torment he expected in someone who had confronted such truths. If anything, she radiated a peace so profound it was almost unsettling. Was that the price of true freedom? Accepting every part of himself, even the shadows he’d avoided for so long? 

Georgia turned her gaze to the window, her eyes drifting over the tidy suburban landscape outside. “We live in a world of constant distraction and consumption, Bud. People are searching for meaning, but they’re looking in all the wrong places. The protocol offers a way out, a path to true fulfillment that doesn’t depend on external circumstances. The dharma will find a way.” 

“Sure,” Bud replied, still torn. “But what kind of world will it find when it gets there?”
