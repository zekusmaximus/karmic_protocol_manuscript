“The Committee now recognizes Senator Steven Yost,” Chairman Roberts announced, his tone firm. 

Frank’s back straightened. The sudden attention on Yost suggested that someone with real influence was pulling strings behind the scenes. He needed to stay sharp. 

“Thank you, Mr. Chairman,” Yost said, his voice deep and commanding, filling the chamber effortlessly. “I’ve listened carefully to today’s testimony about the supposed dangers of this technology. I’ve heard concerns about market disruption, social stability, and religious authority. What I haven’t heard is any recognition of the fundamental American principle that an individual’s spiritual journey is their own.” 

Frank’s jaw clenched. This was the narrative he feared, a defense of personal freedom that could chip away at the foundation he had meticulously constructed. 

He paused, letting the silence deepen the impact of his words. Frank’s eyes moved across the room, noting the shifting postures of several committee members. The discomfort was unmistakable, and Frank felt the tension tighten in his gut. 

“I will admit, in my district alone, three major employers have restructured after key executives went through the protocol. Our largest bank branch operates with a skeleton crew since half their traders simply walked away. The hospital’s entire neurology department has shifted to free community care.” Frank made a fist as the Senator concluded this comment. 

“However, also in my district, I’ve met many people who have used the protocol. Yes, some have made dramatic life changes. But isn’t that what spiritual awakening has always done? When someone has a profound religious experience that leads them to join a monastery, we don’t convene congressional hearings. When someone has an epiphany that causes them to change careers and dedicate their life to service, we don’t investigate them for market disruption. The protocol doesn’t appear to be forcing anyone to abandon their roles. It’s opening a door to reimagine them. Perhaps instead of fearing this change, we should be asking how we can support it.” 

Frank’s pulse quickened as Representative Green’s expression softened, and he nodded slowly. 

“Would you say the government response has been disproportionate, Senator?” Green asked, his voice carrying a tone of genuine curiosity. 

Frank’s jaw tensed as he waited for Yost’s response, which came swiftly. “Disproportionate doesn’t begin to cover it,” Yost said, his words resonant and unforgiving. “We’ve had warrantless raids, illegal detentions, evidence fabrication, and what appears to be a coordinated campaign of suppression, all against American citizens exercising their constitutional right to pursue spiritual enlightenment through technological means.” 

Frank’s stomach churned. Yost’s accusations threatened to tear down the scaffolding he’d built so carefully. He wanted someone to interject, to push back against the Senator’s momentum. 

“But what about the family disruptions?” Representative Miller interrupted, his voice sharp with urgency. “We heard testimony.” 

“With respect,” Yost cut in, his tone unwavering, “this committee heard carefully selected anecdotes. I could present dozens of cases where the protocol has strengthened families, improved relationships, and enhanced communities. Mrs. Martinez’s story is tragic, but are we going to ban all spiritual practices because sometimes they lead to divorce? Should we investigate every ashram or monastery because sometimes people leave their jobs to join them?” 

Frank’s gaze shifted to Roberts, who was leaning toward an aide, his lips moving in a whispered exchange. The chairman’s furrowed brow suggested he was scrambling to piece together how Yost had managed to slip onto the witness list. Frank’s unease grew; Yost’s words were carving gaping holes in their narrative. 

“Mr. Wilson testified about losing an employee,” Green noted, breaking the quiet with a pointed comment. Frank’s fingers tightened around the edge of his notepad. He could sense the shift in the room and knew Green’s question had the potential to swing sympathy. 

“But couldn’t one argue that someone choosing to serve the homeless is actually increasing their social contribution?” Green added. 

“Exactly,” Yost said, seizing the moment. Frank felt a pulse of frustration throbbing in his temple. The Senator was reframing the narrative effortlessly. “We seem to be defining ‘productive member of society’ solely in terms of economic activity. That’s not only short-sighted, but it’s also fundamentally un-American. Our nation was founded by people seeking spiritual freedom from government control.” 

Frank’s breath caught as Yost turned his attention to Cray, the Under Secretary. This was calculated. “Under Secretary, you testified about neural architecture changes. Were any of these changes actually harmful to the individuals involved?” 

Cray’s shoulders tensed as he shifted uncomfortably. Frank’s jaw clenched. Cray needed to handle this carefully. “The long-term effects are unknown…” 

“That’s not what I asked,” Yost cut in, his voice slicing through the chamber. “Did your testing show any actual harm to the subject?” 

Frank’s pulse quickened, willing Cray to regain control of the exchange. “No direct physical harm, but…” 

“So, in essence,” Yost pressed on, “federal agents detained an American citizen, subjected them to involuntary medical testing, and found no evidence of harm, all because this person chose to pursue a form of spiritual practice the government doesn’t approve of?” 

A murmur rippled through the chamber, and Frank’s eyes darted to the press gallery. Reporters were scribbling furiously, capturing every word. The narrative was slipping, becoming something he could no longer steer. 

“The real threat here isn’t to our social fabric,” Yost concluded, his voice dropping to a near whisper that demanded attention. “It’s the precedent we set when we allow government agencies to decide which paths to enlightenment are acceptable. Whether through prayer, meditation, or yes, even technology, the individual’s quest for spiritual truth must remain inviolate. Otherwise, what are we really trying to protect?” 

The silence that followed seemed denser than the space itself, pressing down on Frank as he watched Roberts conferring with other committee members. The chairman’s face was drawn, and the tension in his posture spoke volumes. The hearing was slipping beyond the control Frank had so painstakingly orchestrated. 

“Counselor,” Representative Green’s voice cut through the room, drawing Frank’s attention back to the exchange, “given Senator Yost’s points about religious freedom, how does the FTC justify treating this as a consumer protection issue?” 

Frank’s eyes narrowed as FTC attorney shifted uncomfortably. “Well,” he started, then hesitated, a crack in his confident veneer. “I suppose one could argue that our existing frameworks aren’t really equipped to handle this type of technology…” 

Frank suppressed a grimace. It was a weak response, and he knew it. The lines they’d rehearsed were crumbling under the weight of the unexpected debate. 

“And director,” Green continued, turning swiftly, “how do you reconcile your calls for government intervention with the First Amendment’s religious protections?” 

Frank’s pulse quickened. The director, normally so assured, faltered. “This isn’t a traditional religious practice…” 

“Neither was speaking in tongues when it first appeared,” Green interjected. “Should the government have regulated that?”
