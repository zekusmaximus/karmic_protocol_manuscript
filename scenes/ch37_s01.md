“I didn’t want to believe our own government was capable of this,” Senator Yost said, pacing the floor. His voice echoed off the polished wood panels of the Senate office, a sharp contrast to the deep silence weighing down the room. Jessica sat in the corner, her notepad balanced on her knee, the tension drawing her shoulders tight. 

“Still nothing about the whereabouts of Georgia Sato?” he asked, his gaze darting to Jessica. 

“No,” she replied, steadying her voice as she made a quick note. The absence of updates felt like an itch she couldn’t reach. “Tim Mulvaney is still missing too, along with several others the government believes to be involved. The administration denies any knowledge of anyone disappearing.” 

“Being disappeared,” Paul Freemont, the Senator’s Chief of Staff, interjected, his tone biting through the unease. 

Jessica’s jaw tightened as she nodded. “Yes, being disappeared, sir,” she echoed, the phrase digging into her mind like a splinter. The pieces didn’t fit, but it was becoming harder to ignore the signs that pointed to an overreach by Homeland Security or another shadowed agency.

Jessica couldn’t help the chill that settled in her chest. Georgia Sato’s sudden vanishing gnawed at her, but it was Tim’s absence that kept her awake at night. Dharamshala had been his intended destination, a carefully orchestrated escape. Now, every missed check-in only confirmed her fears: he’d been intercepted. 

“If I may, gentlemen,” she said, leaning forward, hoped to keep her voice measured, “perhaps a more public appeal is needed. Our briefings have stalled, and with the hearing coming up, state and federal information sharing feels more critical than ever.” 

The Senator paused, considering her words with a furrowed brow. “Perhaps,” he muttered. 

Paul sighed, lifting his hands as if the weight of the situation might lift with the gesture. “We could ask the Governor to issue an official public request for information.” 

Jessica glanced at the Senator, catching the fleeting frustration in his expression. “I’ve already tried her office, Paul,” he said, shoulders falling. “It’s too risky for her. They’re in ‘wait and see’ mode.” 

“Georgia’s not a big enough donor?” Paul quipped, earning a brief, unexpected laugh from Jessica. The tension cracked for just a moment, and the Senator’s pacing stopped as he turned and allowed a smirk. 

Jessica watched as the Senator checked his watch, then picked up his laptop from a table in the corner. “I need to work on my testimony,” he said, the resolve in his voice hardened like a blade. “This hearing might be our chance to make an appeal or at least push the press to ask the right questions.”
