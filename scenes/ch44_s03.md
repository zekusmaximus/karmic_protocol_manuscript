Frank felt a chill run down his spine as he watched his carefully built narrative unravel further. Senator Yost’s testimony had turned the tide. Even Wilson and Martinez, whose emotional stories were supposed to anchor the committee’s resolve, now seemed hesitant, their expressions clouded with doubt. Yost’s argument had reframed everything, pulling at the constitutional strings Frank had hoped would remain untouched. 

His thoughts strayed to Cray’s testimony and how rapidly it had spiraled. They’d been prepared for scrutiny, for tough questions. But they weren’t ready for ridicule, nor for the momentum to shift so completely. This hearing was supposed to serve as the cornerstone for broader action. Instead, it felt like a referendum on government overreach. 

The vibration of his phone jarred him back. He glanced at the screen: a message from an unknown number. “The dharma finds its way.” His fingers tightened instinctively before he deleted it. 

The waning afternoon light cast long shadows over the chamber. Roberts called for closing statements, the gavel’s echo resonating in the tense silence. Frank’s hand moved automatically to his phone, typing out a message to his team. They needed to shift to contingency plans, and fast. The protocol slipping from their grasp was no longer a possibility, it was a looming certainty. 

As he surveyed the room one last time, his gaze landed on Bud Turner. His former protégé glanced away, but not before Frank caught the look on his face. It wasn’t defiance or challenge, it was pity. That sting cut deeper than he expected. 

Roberts brought the session to a close, and the room broke into motion. Frank watched as Cray gathered his papers with robotic precision, Martinez was surrounded by staffers offering quiet consolation, and Wilson spoke animatedly to a cluster of reporters. The elements Frank had so meticulously orchestrated now seemed hollow, stage props in a drama that no longer resonated. 

Straightening his tie, he moved toward the exit. Tomorrow’s closed session would tackle enforcement measures, but a part of him already knew it was too late. The words from the deleted message haunted him as he stepped out into the cold February air: The dharma finds its way. 

Behind him, the relentless gears of government churned on, processing testimony into policy, tragedy into regulation, fear into law. But deep down, Frank sensed they had unleashed something beyond containment, a force no legislation could leash. He quickened his pace toward the waiting car, the certainty gnawing at him: in their bid to hold the world as it was, they had only hastened its transformation into something new. The last light of day glanced off the Capitol dome, gilding it briefly before giving way to the encroaching dusk.
