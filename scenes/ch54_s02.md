Minutes later, Jessica arrived, her stride purposeful, her face a mask of determination.  

“You’ve got news?” Tim prompted, straightening from the railing as Jessica approached. 

“Cray’s falling apart,” she said without preamble. “His last-ditch effort to mobilize support is backfiring spectacularly. More officials are running the protocol, and they’re walking away from him. The agencies he tried to use against us? They’re dissolving from within.” 

Finn let out a low whistle. “That’s… poetic.” 

“Since the committee’s decision, Cray’s influence has continued to wane,” Jessica said. “The agencies are quietly shelving his proposals. Even his most reliable allies are distancing themselves.” 

She glanced at the production line below. “O’Hearn’s corporate raid gave them perfect cover to back away. They’re painting this as a private sector dispute rather than a security threat.” 

Tim exchanged a glance with Finn. “Dissolution through exposure,” he said quietly. 

Jessica nodded. “They fought so hard to stop it, but now they’re being undone by the very thing they feared most.” 

Tim sighed. “Cray, O’Hearn, Guy… all of it unraveling.” 

Zach’s gaze moved to the observation deck, where the final headsets continued their steady progress down the line. “And us?” he asked, the question hanging heavy in the air. 

Tim’s response came after a long pause. “We hold the line. For now.” 

The quiet that followed was expectant, each of them turning inward to consider what holding the line truly meant. Finn looked toward the observation deck, a beaming smile on his face. “I built this thing, and for a long time, I thought that was enough. But it’s not, is it? It’s what it does, what it’ll mean to everyone who uses it, that matters.” 

Zach crossed his arms, his gaze distant. “We’re not in control of it. That’s the hardest part for me to accept. We set this in motion, but now it’s bigger than us. Bigger than anything we could have imagined.” 

Jessica stepped closer to him, her voice quiet but firm. “That’s why we have to let it go after the next production run. Trust that what we’ve done is enough for now.” 

Zach’s eyes met hers, and for the first time in weeks, there was no hesitation in his expression. “You’re right. It’s not about control. It never was.” 

Tim watched them, his chest tightening with something that felt like pride. They had all come so far. Jessica, stepping into her power with grace and conviction; Zach, finally shedding the weight of guilt; Finn, finding purpose beyond the machines he created. They were ready. 

Tim’s voice broke the moment. “I need to tell you something.” 

The others turned toward him. Tim exhaled, his gaze lingering on each of them in turn. 

“I’ve made a decision,” he said. “And it’s one I’ve wrestled with for a long time. Since before the protocol was even fully formed.” 

Jessica tilted her head slightly, curiosity flickering in her eyes. “What decision?” 

Tim turned back to the observation deck, the hum of the production line filling the space. “I’m not going to use it. The protocol.” 

The silence that followed was heavy, punctuated only by the faint whir of machinery. Finn was the first to respond, his voice incredulous. “You’re serious? After everything we’ve been through?” 

“I am,” Tim replied, his tone unwavering. “I believe in what we’ve done. I believe in its potential to change the world. But someone has to stay on the outside. Someone has to see it for what it is, for what it becomes.” 

Zach’s expression softened, understanding dawning. “You’re choosing to be the anchor.” 

Tim nodded. “Maybe that’s what my brother would have done if he’d had the chance. He always told me that the world needs witnesses. People who can stand apart, observe, and guide without being consumed.” 

Jessica stepped closer, her voice low but steady. “It’s a lot to carry, Tim.” 

“I know,” he said, meeting her gaze. “But I’ve carried worse. And this… this is worth it.” 

Finn let out a breath, running a hand through his hair. “You’re something else, you know that?” 

Tim chuckled softly. “I’ve been called worse.” 

The group stood together. Tim’s decision wasn’t just his own; it was a reflection of everything they’d fought for, a reminder that even in transformation, someone must hold the line, protect the dharma.
