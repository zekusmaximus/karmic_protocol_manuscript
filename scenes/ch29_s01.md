“Joe Bronski, as I live and breathe!” Bud called out, spotting Joe making his way down the street toward the coffee shop. The sight of his old friend brought a rare smile to his face. 

“Mister Bud Turner, the legend,” Joe responded, weaving through the small gate into the outdoor seating area. Bud stood up, and they embraced briefly. He took in Joe’s tailored suit and confident stride, a reflection of his new role. 

“You have that vice-presidential air about you. We should plan a celebration at Hull’s,” Bud said, referring to Joe’s recent leap into upper management. His voice carried the genuine warmth of a mentor proud of his protégé. 

Joe’s grin widened, though he waved off the idea with a hint of playful humility. “Hull’s is your domain; I don’t have enough friends to fill even a corner table there, let alone the whole place,” he joked, though Bud noted the flicker of pride behind the self-deprecation. “Seriously though, thanks for the assist with the board.” 

Bud settled back into his chair, chuckling. “In all honesty, I’ve never recommended someone who needed it less,” he said, the week-old fatigue of parental leave still clinging to his bones but failing to dull his sharpness. He was fully back in stride now. 

Joe slid into the seat across from him and reached for the coffee Bud had preemptively ordered. “It’s not every day an executive position opens up. I’m glad you gave me that nudge to apply.” 

“Speaking of which, any word from Zach?” Bud asked, keeping his tone neutral as he sipped his coffee. 

“Nothing,” Joe said, gaze dropping to his cup. The hesitance, the averted eyes, it wasn’t lost on Bud. The lie tasted unconvincing even from across the table. “The charges were dropped, and no one’s heard from him. Not that I’m surprised. I doubt he’d be reaching out after what happened.” 

“Yeah, bad business,” Bud murmured, shaking his head. He let his voice drop just enough for only Joe to hear. “Between me and you, Frank didn’t handle that situation well.” 

Joe’s laugh was short, a little too abrupt, before he leaned forward, voice lowered. “Chairman O’Hearn’s made this protocol his personal obsession. Sometimes I wonder if we’re not just an arm of the administration.” 

Bud’s expression didn’t shift, but inside, a pang of recognition hit. He’d seen the seeds of this long before. “They got you on any of those projects?” he asked, watching Joe’s reaction closely. 

Joe’s response was instant, too smooth. “Nope. Just the usual. After the Goodman mess, it’s all hands on deck to push units. Frank really believes if the karmic protocol gets out there no one will wants our products anymore.” 

Bud managed a dry chuckle, masking his suspicions. They both laughed, a shared echo of camaraderie, and then the conversation lightened. Joe brought up Bud’s new son, anecdotes about his move, TV shows, concerts. Bud found himself enjoying the moment more than he expected. His wife was right: he needed to spend more time around people like Joe, newly promoted, driven, uninterested in the political currents that twisted through their industry. The thought settled comfortably as Bud resolved to make these meetups more frequent. 

Joe’s expression grew serious as he leaned in. “So, what are your thoughts about the protocol?” 

Bud paused, the question catching him off guard. What were his thoughts? They weren’t the same as they had been when he first learned about it. He searched for the right words. “I’m intrigued,” he said at last. “Not as worried as I used to be. Of course, it may all be academic at this point, seeing as the last I heard, the administration destroyed all the prototypes and notes.” 

Joe’s brows lifted in surprise. “Really? O’Hearn certainly doesn’t seem to believe that.” 

Bud allowed himself to smile. “Facts rarely get in the way of a well-developed belief,” he said. Memories of the fallout from the Sato factory raid surfaced, leaving a bitter aftertaste. “After the embarrassment over that ridiculous raid, the administration must have realized the whole thing was more trouble than it was worth, whether or not they’ve truly stopped the protocol.” 

Joe nodded, the glint in his eyes suggesting he was impressed by how much Bud knew. 

“Once the cease-and-desist was tossed out with the Goodman charges, holding onto the tech became a liability,” Bud continued. “Frank, though, can’t allow himself to see it that way, not with the civil IP suit still looming. But that’ll be thrown out too, mark my words.” 

“You’re convinced Goodman did nothing wrong?” Joe’s tone was probing but light. 

“Nothing worth suing over,” Bud said, gesturing with open palms. “Certainly, nothing illegal. Why? Do you think otherwise?” 

Joe laughed, a sharp, knowing sound. “Oh, he’s the company scapegoat. If toilet paper went missing from the supply closet, they’d say Zach Goodman took it. But no, I worked with him. He was solid. Honestly, from what I’ve heard about the protocol, I doubt we had anything that would have helped.” 

“At least we finally solved why he was so anxious about the government banning a VR platform,” Bud said, his hand slapping the table lightly as he chuckled. 

Joe’s laughter echoed the sentiment. “So, besides O’Hearn’s obsession, do you think this protocol business is behind us?” 

“For now,” Bud replied, his voice thoughtful. He glanced past Joe to the busy street beyond. “But with any innovation, no matter how much the government, industry, or even religious powers try to bury it, it finds a way to resurface. We may not have seen the end of the Karmic Protocol. Or if we have, we’ll see something else, perhaps not in this exact form, maybe not rooted in Buddhist concepts, but there’s been enough attention on this. Amateurs will tinker with similar ideas for years.” 

“Why does the electric car come to mind?” Joe said, laughed. 

Bud smirked and raised his eyebrows theatrically. “And we’re still successfully suppressing cold fusion for the energy companies,” he said, draining the last of his coffee. 

Joe leaned back, his chair creaking as he relaxed. “This was nice, Bud. Good to see you back, refreshed, and a dad!” 

“Agreed,” Bud said, pushing back his chair and standing up. “Let me know if you hear anything else. I’ll do the same, though I’m sure you’ll be so busy moving units that gossip won’t be on your radar.” 

“True, but it’s fun to spread when I come across some,” Joe replied, grinning. “Say hi to Cindy and George for me.”

As Bud made his way back to the office, a pang of disappointment settled over him. The protocol hadn’t turned into the issue for him he once feared it would become. His mind flickered to Constance and how she had insisted on the prototypes’ destruction, citing rumors of potential weaponization. The idea was almost laughable, he couldn’t imagine how it would work, but he trusted her judgment. He sighed, resigning himself. On to the next crisis, he thought, as he walked along.
