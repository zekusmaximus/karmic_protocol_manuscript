Tim turned toward the driveway, noting the fenced perimeter and guardhouse where Finn stood watch. He spotted Jessica driving up in her car as Finn called out, “Everything’s locked up, and I don’t have the keys.” 

Tim chuckled, jogging over and pulling out a keychain. “Good on both points,” he replied, unlocking the gate as Finn moved aside. 

“What’s good, Jessica?” Finn asked, patting her shoulder as she leaned out the window. 

She gave a wry smile. “Not sure if it’s a blessing or a curse, but we definitely live in interesting times.” 

Tim stepped back, locking the gate after Jessica drove through. “One can never be too careful,” he said, meeting Finn’s gaze. “Safety is a good habit to get into.” 

Tim watched as Jessica parked and surveyed the building. Georgia had done her part. Finding this location hadn’t been easy, not with the electrical demands of their AI project. Now it was up to Tim and the team to map out the layout, identifying what tools, machines and staff they’d need for production. 

Georgia was already distracted, her eyes glued to her phone. She glanced up briefly, tension flickering across her usually composed features. “I’ll leave you boys to it. There’s been some concerning stock movement at one of my larger companies - someone’s been quietly accumulating shares through multiple accounts.” She paused, thumb scrolling rapidly. “Never a dull moment in corporate games,” she said, heading to her car. Tim watched her go, noting how her shoulders had tightened at whatever she’d seen on the screen. He’d rarely seen anything rattle Georgia’s calm demeanor. 

As she drove off, Jessica turned to Tim. “I worked at a tool shop in college. Never thought I’d come full circle back to manufacturing,” she said, trailing Tim to the entrance. 

Tim smirked, recognizing the irony. 

Finn chimed in as they stepped inside, “There are many paths to enlightenment. Now, let’s see what we’re working with.” 

Tim surveyed the interior. Offices flanked the main hallway, leading to a wide-open manufacturing room in the back. More space than they’d need initially, but that suited him just fine. 

They moved through the building, noting down measurements and potential workstation layouts. The covert nature of their project infused the task with adrenaline-fueled excitement that Tim relished. 

“The microchips need to be custom made here,” Tim said, running a mental checklist as they concluded their tour. If only Sarah had joined the dharmapalas instead of going through the protocol. She could have come in handy. He wondered what she was up to, if she even thought of microchips or codes anymore. He smiled, knowing she was awake, shook it off and got back to the business at hand.
