“Just five working headsets?” Bud asked Constance over the video feed, disbelief tightening his jaw. He had sneaked down to his home office for the call, ignoring the stern warnings from his wife about staying away from work during paternity leave. His other screen silently scrolled market alerts, “Advent Industries’ latest aggressive moves against Sato’s tech portfolio.” 

“A few others in various stages of completion, but only five they claimed were functional,” Constance said, a slight shrug in her voice. Bud noted how even over video, her confidence came through. “Their notes were meticulous, though. The logs showed exactly who went through the protocol and which headset each person used. For amateurs, their diligence was surprising.” 

Bud’s brow furrowed. “No sign of a larger manufacturing setup? No hidden facility on the property?” 

“Nothing,” she confirmed. “They kept everything confined to one room in the basement. They even maintained a sign-in sheet for anyone who entered that space. This wasn’t some sprawling, clandestine operation. It was slow, deliberate, and limited.” 

Bud processed the information, mentally tallying the implications. “So, only 27 people subjected to the protocol as far as we know,” he said, his mind turning over the possibility. If that were true, then where could they have scaled up production? They must be scaling this. It didn’t add up. 

“The hermitage at Jeta’s Grove turned out clean,” Constance added, breaking his train of thought. “No headsets, no notes, nothing electronic at all. Homeland Security’s search of the place confirmed our intel, it’s just a secluded area where a few of them practiced and taught Buddhism.” 

Bud clenched his teeth. It felt wrong, incomplete. There had to be more. 

“Anything on Georgia Sato?” Constance’s voice cut through the silence that had stretched between them. 

“No,” Bud said, shaking his head. Frustration tightened his chest. “She donated the land, visited the retreat, but there’s no trace of any other ties. I’m trying to pull strings, get some colleagues to dig through her business holdings. But she’s careful, possibly even better connected than I am. Her reputation’s flawless, or it was until O’Hearn started his takeover bid.” 

“Well,” Constance said, her tone shifting, “nothing’s come up in the search for unusual microchip purchases. Your list of required goods for mass production was solid, though. Our partners are staying vigilant.” She paused, but Bud could tell she was choosing her next words carefully. “Of course, with O’Hearn attempting to gain control of several semiconductor companies in Sato’s portfolio, tracking chip production will get… complicated.” 

Bud leaned back, the creak of the chair loud in the stillness of his office. Were they heading this off before it exploded into something unmanageable?  

“It seems like we’re doing everything possible right now,” Constance continued. “The cease-and-desist order is active, the hardware’s confiscated, and we’re questioning everyone involved while keeping watch on potential associates.” 

“How about Zach Goodman?” Bud pressed, his voice firm as he steered the conversation back on track. “Has he been brought in yet on the criminal charges?” 

Constance shook her head, her gaze shifting down as if reviewing something on her desk. “Not yet. O’Hearn’s legal team is pushing hard, but with his corporate moves making headlines, the prosecutors are worried about the appearance of coordination. Another way he may be shooting himself in the foot. Official line… they’re still drafting the charges and clearing the warrant. It’s taking time, they want to make sure everything’s airtight.” 

Bud swallowed, searching for the right words to frame his next question. “So, did they, uh, find what O’Hearn suspected they would?” 

“Yes,” Constance confirmed, her voice dropping to a hushed tone. “Evidence linking the origins of the protocol to Goodman’s company was secured at the retreat center.” 

Bud nodded slowly. He hadn’t entirely supported Frank’s push to implicate Goodman, but for now, it seemed to be going smoothly. At the very least, it would tie up Zach in legal battles, keeping him out of their way while prosecutors unraveled the complexities. 

“And Tim Mulvaney?” Bud pressed, a frown forming. 

“No trace,” Constance replied, her tone edged with frustration. “Witnesses and the evidence suggest he left the retreat center right after the conference and hasn’t been seen at his residence or the Sato property since we began our search.” 

Bud’s attention shifted when he caught movement at the doorway. Cheryl stood there, cradling their newborn son. A surge of guilt and warmth rushed through him. He hurriedly ended the call with Constance. “I’ll check in later,” he muttered, clicking off the video feed. 

“Cheryl,” he said, moving quickly to close the distance between them. 

“Don’t you Cheryl me, Freeman Turner,” she said, her voice as cold as it was resolute. Bud’s stomach tightened; she only used his full name when he was in trouble. “You’re supposed to be on parental leave. You’ve got the ‘paternity’ part down, but the ‘leave’ part seems to be slipping your mind.” 

Bud managed a half-smile. “Would it help if I said it wasn’t work?” 

The silence that followed answered for her. Her expression softened as she unwrapped their son and placed the baby into his arms. 

“Well, it certainly sounded like work,” she said, a hint of a smile starting to form. “George Turner and I deserve your undivided attention. Before long, you’ll be back at work, and these moments won’t come so easily.” 

Bud glanced down at the tiny fingers gripping his thumb. Cheryl’s gentle touch as she cooed at the baby warmed the moment. “Isn’t that right, little Georgy?” she murmured. 

He walked with her out of the office, heading toward the living room. “George,” he corrected, giving her a mock-serious look. The nickname “Georgy” rubbed him the wrong way, though he couldn’t quite said why. Maybe it was the way he bristled at being called “Buddy” himself, a name no one really used but still irked him. It was a harmless annoyance, an excuse to tease him. 

“Isn’t that right, Georgy Porgy?” Cheryl countered, laughter dancing in her eyes. 

Bud groaned theatrically. “Hey! That’s worse!”
