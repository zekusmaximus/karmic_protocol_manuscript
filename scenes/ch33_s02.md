The assembled group crowded around a metal table as one of Trout’s staff began the briefing. Fiona kept her eyes on the staffer’s face, searching for any sign that this would be different, that they might finally find an answer instead of more questions. 

“Subject is a 49-year-old female in good health. United States citizen, college educated, former special education teacher.” The clinical recitation hit Fiona like a sudden chill. Her fingers twitched, a reflexive response to a realization she was unwilling to accept. 

Fiona felt her skin prickle with sudden dread. The name formed in her mind before she could stop it, a grim certainty hardening in her gut. She knew before the glass cleared who they would see. 

The observation room lights revealed a scene that made her stomach clench. Sherry Carpenter. The woman was unrecognizable, stripped of her humanity by the sterile setup. Strapped to a chair, her head shaved and locked into a scaled-down MRI apparatus, EEG leads snaked across her scalp. Yet somehow, inexplicably, she was smiling. 

“My God,” Fiona whispered. The words barely escaped her, the metallic taste of fear souring her tongue. Next to her, she felt her partner go rigid. His body stilled, tightened. 

“The data is remarkable,” Trout said, pulling up brain scans on her tablet. The clinical detachment in Trout’s voice clashed with the horror gnawing at Fiona’s core. “Persistent alterations in default mode network connectivity. Increased neural plasticity in areas associated with self-referential processing. Complete reorganization of emotional regulation pathways.” 

“Brain damage?” Cray asked eagerly, leaning forward. The question rang in Fiona’s ears, sharp and eager, an affront to the human suffering laid bare before them, despite the sufferer appearing to be fine with it. 

“That’s the problem,” Trout replied. Fiona watched her, noting the tension etched into the director’s expression. “By conventional metrics, these changes appear beneficial. Decreased anxiety response, enhanced emotional regulation, improved cognitive flexibility. But the scale and permanence of the alterations…” Trout’s voice faltered, and Fiona felt a flicker of unease. “We’re talking about fundamental rewiring of human consciousness.” 

“Like I said, a virus,” the reverend muttered. Fiona’s gaze shifted to him, irritation flaring at his persistent, simplistic take on the crisis. 

“Not exactly.” Trout zoomed in on one scan. Fiona leaned closer, her eyes tracing the colorful web of neural pathways displayed on the screen. “There’s no damage or forced alterations. It’s more like the brain finding its optimal operating state. The changes are subtle, increased connectivity in attention networks, reduced activity in the default mode network, lasting changes in how the brain processes self-referential thoughts.” 

The sterile technicality of Trout’s explanation did little to ease the knot in Fiona’s chest. This was a fundamental shift in what it meant to be human. 

She glanced at the reverend and felt an unwelcome pang of recognition. Trout might admire his conviction, but from Fiona’s perspective, his certainty bordered on fanaticism. There were times, late in their strategy sessions, when Fiona caught the way Trout’s gaze would linger on him as if in awe. The unshakeable belief he embodied, that unyielding confidence that what they were doing was God’s work, was foreign to Fiona. 

Where the reverend could rally with faith and righteousness, Fiona held on to the practicality that came with years in federal service, where black and white blurred into bureaucratic gray. 

“You’re missing the point,” Cray cut in, derailing Fiona’s train of thought. He turned away from the window where he’d been studying Sherry, his eyes sharp with an intensity that made Fiona’s stomach tighten. 

“Twenty-three years in this department. Started in counterterrorism, tracking groups trying to reshape society through force. The true believers were always the most dangerous, not because they were violent, but because they were convinced they were serving a higher purpose.” He gestured at Sherry. Fiona’s gaze flicked to the woman, strapped and eerily calm. “This is far more insidious, voluntary transformation of human consciousness itself.” 

O’Hearn’s voice broke through the mounting silence, drawing Fiona’s attention back. “The Harbridge simulations,” he said, the phrase weighted with shared knowledge. “Like dominoes.” 

“Exactly.” Cray began to pace, the tension in the room ratcheting up with each step. Fiona tracked his movement, feeling the impact of each pointed word settle like lead in her chest. “One person stops believing in money, property, social obligations? Not a problem. A thousand people? Manageable. But hit a certain percentage…” He jabbed a finger at the brain scans, the gesture as sharp as a warning. “The whole system collapses before we realize what’s happening.” 

Trout’s nod was grim, confirming what Fiona feared. “We’ve seen it before. My first case at the FDA was a new antidepressant. Worked beautifully in trials, people felt better, functioned better. But six months in, we noticed something strange. People weren’t just happier, they were rejecting basic social contracts. Leaving jobs, ending relationships, withdrawing from society. Not because they were depressed, but because they no longer saw the point.” 

A cold shiver ran down Fiona’s spine. The idea of society unraveling not from violence but from apathy was far more terrifying than any threat she’d faced in the field. “What happened?” she asked. The question hung in the room, unanswered, and Fiona felt a grim anticipation for what Trout would say next. 

“We pulled it. Had to. Even though it was ‘working’ perfectly by medical standards,” Trout said, pulling up another file. Fiona leaned in, the tension coiling tighter in her chest. “Now look at these protocol users. Three months in: they stop shopping except for essentials. Stop pursuing career advancement. Stop engaging in social obligations. They’re not depressed or dysfunctional, they just step completely outside the social system.” 

Fiona’s pulse quickened as she processed Trout’s words. The implications were staggering, more profound than any threat she’d faced in her career. 

“And unlike your antidepressant, this change is permanent,” Cray added. “No going back.”
