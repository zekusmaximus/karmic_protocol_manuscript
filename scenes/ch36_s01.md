Tim sat on a bench, staring out over the vast, rippling ocean. The ship he was scheduled to board would depart in an hour. The others had already gone ahead, and he knew he should have joined them, but the thought of leaving without speaking to Georgia kept him rooted. 

The thought of her joining the awakened brought a mix of emotions, pride tinged with regret. She had been one of their strongest allies, a loss the dharmapala would feel keenly. If only she had given them more time. But he knew it wasn’t his choice to make; it never had been. The wheel of fate was spinning now, and all he could do was try to guard it, not control its pace. 

Still, she had done well. Georgia had secured the resources they needed to carry on their mission of spreading the protocol. For that, Tim was grateful. She’d also made arrangements for his core team’s passage abroad, a method slow enough to avoid attention but safe. He swallowed the bitter taste of loss; he would miss her. 

Tim pulled the visor of his cap lower to block the setting sun’s glare. A wave of exhaustion washed over him, a reminder of the relentless pace he had kept since the protocol’s release. Maybe, just maybe, he could rest during the journey. The sudden tap on his shoulder shattered that hope. 

“Timothy Mulvaney.” The voice behind him was clear and authoritative. 

Tim’s breath hitched as he registered the name. He didn’t need to turn to recognize the speaker. A government agent, he thought. Not magic, just instinct honed through years of work. So close, he cursed silently. 

“Your meeting with the Dalai Lama is going to have to wait,” Agent Gyle said, stepping into his peripheral vision. On the opposite side, another agent, whom Tim guessed was her partner, completed the pincer movement. 

Tim’s mind churned as he pieced together how they had tracked him. The mention of His Holiness was telling. Georgia’s network of financiers had believed their destination was Dharamshala for a meeting with the revered Buddhist leader. A pang of disappointment dulled the sharp edge of his thoughts. He shouldn’t have expected any less. 

Of course, the Dalai Lama was never part of their itinerary. The protocols they shipped to Dharamshala had been for his exiled government, not a personal audience. Their true aim lay deeper: the vast library at Sakya Monastery, where they intended to hide and begin digging through the largest collection of untranslated Buddhist scriptures in existence. 

Tim removed his cap and sunglasses, setting them carefully on the bench. “It’s an honor to meet you,” he said, spreading his hands slightly to show he was unarmed. 

The agents remained expressionless as they patted him down. Their silence spoke volumes as they guided him away from the bench, down the pier, and into a waiting van. Tim noted their subtle relief, their barely restrained smiles. They were satisfied with a clean apprehension, but it only fueled his resolve. 

Tim managed a small smile, aware that even with his capture, it was too late to halt the awakening that had already begun. They placed a hood over his head and threw him into a waiting vehicle. The van rumbled beneath him, and he closed his eyes, hoping for a moment’s rest before the next phase of whatever awaited him. They drove for a long time, then escorted him into a building. After restraining him to a chair they left him alone. He waited.
