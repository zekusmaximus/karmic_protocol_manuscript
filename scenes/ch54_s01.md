In the basement lab beneath the small hermitage, Tim watched Zach working the keyboard, quantum encryption protocols scrolling past on the screen. Zach’s eyes were bleary, red-rimmed from lack of sleep, but Tim didn’t let concern show. The new production facility was almost ready, different location, better security, improved design. They had learned from their mistakes. This time, they were prepared. 

A notification blinked onto the screen: another successful enlightenment reported. The screen had started blinking more than once a day. A small, involuntary smile tugged at Tim’s lips. Let them have their meetings, he thought. The revolution in consciousness couldn’t be halted by memos or regulations. But just as Zach’s smile mirrored his own, Tim noted his eyes blinking with something else. Doubt. Zach rubbed the back of his neck, and unease wormed its way into Tim’s mind. Could this growth outpace even them? 

Zach glanced at the monitor, lips twitching. “Guy’s people are back up at Jeta’s Grove. Third sweep this week.” 

“Looking for what’s no longer up there,” Tim said as he surveyed the converted bunker. 

“O’Hearn must be getting desperate.” Zach’s fingers never stopped typing even as he spoke. “His board called an emergency meeting yesterday. Stock’s down forty percent since the Sato acquisition revealed nothing but legitimate manufacturing.” He paused, something darker crossing his expression. “Guy’s running these surveillance ops on a fraction of his original team. Most of them just… stopped showing up.” 

“How many are left?” 

“Three, maybe?” Zach shrugged. “The interesting part is what they’re doing with the intel. Or rather, not doing. They document everything but it’s like they’re going through the motions, knowing it’s pointless but unable to stop.” 

The production line continued its steady rhythm below them. Another notification flashed: successful enlightenment reported from Singapore. 

“O’Hearn’s running out of resources to waste on this,” Zach continued, his voice softer now. “His corporate empire’s dissolving from within. Not dramatically, people just stop responding to traditional incentives. Can’t motivate someone with a corner office when they’ve seen through the illusion of status.” 

Tim watched another row of headsets move through final testing. “And Guy?” 

“Still thinks he can solve this with tactical teams and surveillance tech.” Zach’s fingers stilled on the keyboard. “Last week they spent three days monitoring a group of arahants starting a free school. Wrote a hundred-page report about the security implications of people choosing to educate children without charging tuition.” 

Tim felt the weight of what remained unsaid. Their opposition wasn’t being defeated, they were becoming irrelevant, their tools of control useless against those who no longer needed controlling. 

The quiet hum of servers filled the pause that followed. Above them, security feeds showed Guy’s team photographing another meditation session at Jeta’s Grove, documenting what they couldn’t understand, fighting what couldn’t be fought. 

Tim climbed to the observation deck, his gaze fixed on the production floor below. The precision of the operation was undeniable. Hundreds of headset units rolled down the line, each one indistinguishable from the next, yet holding the potential to irrevocably alter the consciousness of its wearer. The hum of machinery filled the cavernous space, a relentless rhythm that mirrored the thoughts cycling through his mind. 

This was it. The next production run. He felt no triumph, only the weight of inevitability. The headsets would soon be distributed, and the protocol’s reach would extend far beyond anything they had initially imagined. For better or worse, they had set this in motion. And now, all they could do was watch. 

The sound of hurried footsteps broke his reverie. Finn entered, his tablet clutched tightly under one arm, his expression caught somewhere between exasperation and disbelief. 

“You’re going to love this,” Finn announced. 

Tim arched an eyebrow but didn’t turn away from the production line. “Love isn’t exactly the word I’d use for surprises right now.” 

Finn snorted and held up the tablet. “Henning just announced a new department. The ‘Protocol Preparedness Office.’” 

Tim finally glanced over, curiosity piqued. “What’s their angle?” 

“Officially? It’s a government resource to help individuals and families prepare for the protocol. You know, to ‘responsibly’ integrate awakening into their lives.” Finn made air quotes with his free hand. “They’re pitching it as some kind of guidance initiative, but it’s pretty transparent. It’s about control.” 

Tim took the tablet, scrolling through the announcement. The language was carefully chosen, every word calibrated to suggest authority and benevolence. But beneath the veneer of concern lay the unmistakable fingerprints of fear. Henning and her department were scrambling to reclaim relevance in a world reshaping itself faster than they could adapt. 

“It’s clever,” Tim admitted, his tone neutral. 

“Clever,” Finn echoed, his voice sharper. “It’s also pointless. They can’t control this, Tim. No one can.” 

Tim handed the tablet back, his eyes drifting again to the production floor. “They’ll try anyway. People like Henning always do. They think if they’re the ones holding the reins, they can steer the tide. But tides don’t work that way.” 

Finn leaned against the railing beside him, his energy momentarily quieted. “It’s going to be chaos, isn’t it?” 

Tim nodded slowly. “At first. But chaos has its own kind of order. It’ll find a balance eventually. Just not one anyone can predict.” 

For a moment, they stood in silence. Tim’s thoughts turned inward, grappling with his decision to remain outside the awakening he had helped make possible. It wasn’t doubt that gnawed at him but a sense of responsibility. Someone had to stay grounded, to observe, to hold the line while the world transformed. 

“Henning thinks she can manage this,” Tim said finally, his voice soft but resolute. “But awakening isn’t something you manage. It’s something you survive. And if you’re lucky, something you grow from.” 

Finn glanced at him, a rare note of admiration in his gaze. “You’ve got a way of making chaos sound almost poetic.” 

Tim allowed himself a faint smile. “It’s not poetry. Just the truth.” 

The buzz of Finn’s tablet pulled them both from the moment. He glanced down and frowned, muttering something under his breath before swiping at the screen. 

“What now?” Tim asked, already bracing himself. 

“Jessica,” Finn replied, holding the device up for Tim to see. “She’s got intel. She’s on her way up.”
