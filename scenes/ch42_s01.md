The polished oak panels and heavy blue drapes of the House chamber seemed designed to make witnesses feel small, but they were having the opposite effect on Lawrence Cray. The Under Secretary sat straight at the testimony table, practically vibrating with contained energy as he waited for the chairman to begin. The hearing was his stage, and today, he needed to deliver a performance that would shift the tide in their favor. 

“The Committee will come to order,” Chairman Roberts intoned, his voice steady and authoritative. “Today, we examine the societal and economic implications of the so-called karmic protocol.” 

Cray adjusted the microphone in front of him, glancing briefly at the packed chamber. Journalists perched like vultures in the press gallery, their eyes scanning for weakness. To their left, a cluster of executives from rival tech firms whispered in hushed tones. Cray caught a flicker of motion near the front row, Frank O’Hearn jotting furious notes, his intensity radiating across the room. 

Taking a measured breath, Cray leaned forward. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In my twenty-five years of public service, I have never encountered a more insidious threat to our nation’s security and social fabric.” 

The words fell heavily, as he intended. But as Cray continued, he caught subtle shifts in the room. Representative Green tilted her head slightly, her skeptical expression flickering like a warning light. Cray pressed on, his tone rising. “The protocol systematically alters fundamental motivational structures. We’re seeing this already as more than we thought possible are using it. Goldman Sachs lost 20% of their top traders last quarter, not to competitors, but to resignation and withdrawal. Federal agencies are reporting an alarming trend of employees taking extended leave and returning markedly ‘changed.’ The Atlanta Police Department is struggling to fill their riot squad, and some departments report officers refusing to perform basic enforcement duties after achieving enlightenment.” 

Scanning the Committee he continued, “In the corporate world, three Fortune 500 CEOs have recently redirected entire R&D budgets to environmental restoration projects, citing newfound clarity about their companies’ role in society. This isn’t philanthropy, it’s a fundamental shift in priorities driven by the protocol. Even the military isn’t immune. Pentagon reports detail units rendered unreliable after multiple members achieved enlightenment, compromising readiness and operational cohesion.” 

Pausing to take a drink of water, Cray straightened further in his chair and continued, “These aren’t isolated incidents. Across every major institution, we see withdrawals from economic and civic activities that form the backbone of societal stability. Traditional rewards, career advancement, monetary gain, social status, lose their grip, and the results are destabilizing to the point of systemic risk.” 

Green leaned forward, her lips curling into a faint smile that Cray instantly disliked. “Forgive me, Mr. Cray,” she began, her tone smooth, “but are you suggesting that disengagement from consumer culture is a national security threat?” 

A smattering of chuckles rippled through the room. Cray’s pulse quickened. He forced a tight smile, his fingers curling against his notes. “I’m suggesting, Representative, that the destabilizing effects of mass withdrawal, economic, social, and political, cannot be underestimated.” 

Green didn’t back down. “You’ve mentioned simulations in your prepared remarks, but what about real-world data? Are there cases of violence? Delusions? Paranoia? Anything to suggest this protocol poses an immediate danger?” 

Her tone was surgical, each question cutting away at his carefully constructed argument. Cray tightened his grip on the table’s edge, his composure slipping. “The effects are subtler than that,” he replied, choosing his words carefully. “Consider the Harbridge simulations, cascading disruptions across industries, infrastructure, even governance. It’s not just about individuals; it’s the system as a whole.” 

Cray glanced at Chairman Roberts, hoping for intervention, but the chairman remained impassive. The room hummed with unease, and Cray could feel the narrative slipping from his grasp. He stole another glance at O’Hearn, who was scribbling furiously, his jaw tight. The message was clear: Cray needed to regain control. 

He pivoted, his voice sharpening. “This is not merely an academic concern. We have documented cases of individuals abandoning careers, severing economic ties, and disrupting their communities. When multiplied across thousands, or millions, of participants, the consequences are catastrophic.” 

The word “catastrophic” landed like a hammer, silencing the murmurs. Cray allowed himself a small breath of relief. The moment was tenuous, but he had reasserted some authority. 

“Thank you, Under Secretary,” Chairman Roberts finally said, breaking the silence with a perfunctory tone.
