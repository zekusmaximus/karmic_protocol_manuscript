The sudden removal of the black hood they’d placed over his head marked a shift. Tim couldn’t help a wry thought. It was classic for a group trying to project authority while bending the rules. Good guys, sure, he mused as he blinked against the harsh light, letting his eyes adjust. The room was bare, white-painted concrete walls surrounding him, with a single door and nothing but the chair he was tied to. Three strangers stood in a loose semi-circle, watching him. He hoped Finn wasn’t enduring anything like this in Dharamshala. 

“Water,” he said, partly to quench the dryness in his throat but mostly to test the room, to break the silence. 

The agent closest to him, clad in gear similar to Gile and her partner from their last encounter, stepped forward. Tim’s mind ticked through the possibilities. Homeland Security, maybe? The agent pulled a plastic bottle from a cargo pocket and approached. With a flick of his wrist, he produced a knife and cut the zip ties binding Tim’s hands. Tim flexed his wrists to get blood flowing before unscrewing the cap and drinking deeply, the water burning refreshingly down his parched throat. 

“Was all of this really necessary?” Tim asked, setting the now-empty bottle aside. 

“Shut up,” snapped another agent, his agitation evident in his restless pacing near the door. The first agent took the bottle back and returned it to his pocket, knife thankfully sheathed. Tim took stock; he wasn’t eager to test their limits, but he noted the absence of any more severe methods. 

Moments later, the door creaked open, and Tim’s pulse quickened as Agent Gile walked in. At least this was a familiar face, one he could read, if not trust. The three unknown agents filed out, leaving the room silent but charged as the door shut behind them. 

“Agent, I’ve answered every question you’ve asked, honestly and completely,” Tim said, his voice steady despite the strain. He felt marginally safer with Gile than with the rougher trio who had just left. 

“That only proves we haven’t asked the right questions yet,” she said, flipping open a notepad. “Your compliance has been duly noted, Mr. Mulvaney,” Agent Gile said, stepping closer, her eyes scanning him carefully. 

Tim rubbed his wrists again, wincing at the red marks left by the zip ties. “They didn’t do any visible damage, if that’s what you’re checking for,” he said, letting a hint of sarcasm edge his words. 

“We’re fully aware of what they did and didn’t do,” Gile responded sharply, scribbling something on his notepad. 

Tim’s muscles tensed as Gile’s eyes bore into him. “We need to know where the equipment used to manufacture the protocol is currently hidden or being used to produce more protocols,” she said, her tone unyielding. 

“I wasn’t lying when I said I didn’t know,” Tim replied, a dry cough punctuating his words. The truth, as frustrating as it was. The components had been split up, and the teams responsible for moving them had done so independently. Even if he was inclined to talk, which he wasn’t, there was nothing to give up. Not even torture would change that. 

“And the code?” Gile pressed, not breaking eye contact. 

Tim exhaled slowly. “I told you, the code was uploaded to a hundred different cloud servers, set to replicate and forward at specified intervals.” They’d realize the truth in that out soon enough if they hadn’t already. The safeguards were tight, encryption so advanced it would erase itself without the correct authentication from one of a dozen key holders. 

Gile’s expression hardened. “How do we open the headsets without them destroying themselves?” 

It was the hundredth time she’d asked him this question. Tim knew all she was doing now was confirming she hadn’t cracked it. 

He exhaled, a touch of exasperation escaping. “Please, again, do I look like a tech guy to you? I have no idea.” 

“Who does?” Gile asked, her eyes narrowing. “Goodman? Sato?” 

Tim’s gut twisted, wondering if they had Zach and Georgia. “Why don’t you take the bags off their heads and ask them yourself?” he shot back, voice steady but probing for a reaction. 

Gile didn’t so much as blink. Her stone face offered nothing, revealing no hints about any other detainees. 

“Listen,” Gile said after a brief pause, her tone measured, “I understand you’re not a tech guy, and you’re probably not a coder, either. But you did introduce this untested medical device into the market, and we need to stop you from unleashing more, causing more damage.” 

“Damage?” Tim barked out a laugh, the sound ricocheting off the concrete walls, perhaps a bit louder than he intended. “Damage to whom? The government? The business community? Your Christian friends? What exactly is an enlightened populace going to damage? Democracy? Capitalism? The Catholic Church?” He shook his head, disbelief etched into his features. 

“All of that, yes,” Gile said, undeterred. “And possibly irreversible changes to neural networks, synapse control, brain chemistry. Your reckless actions have caught the attention of the World Health Organization, human rights groups, and nearly every government on the planet.” 

Tim’s chest tightened at the thought of the tests being conducted on the awakened, brain scans, imaging. He hoped they were humane, but he doubted it. The awakened weren’t children, they were modern buddhas, but just because they had extinguished suffering didn’t mean they were impervious to pain. 

“Shipping these things internationally wasn’t your brightest idea,” she added, a smirk barely perceptible. “In all honesty, you’re lucky we got to you first. Anyway, we’re done here. The FDA will officially deem the protocol a schedule one hybrid drug device tomorrow, so this entire mess will become the DEA’s problem. Good riddance.” 

The pieces clicked in Tim’s mind. A strategic move. They would stash him in a dark corner, hopefully alive, while ordering the seizure of every headset in circulation. 

“You’re just prolonging the inevitable,” Tim said, his voice calm and resolute. He wanted them to know he’d come to terms with his fate. “The protocol is an accelerant. It doesn’t do anything that a person couldn’t achieve on their own with enough time and insight.” 

“We’ll feel better letting them achieve it naturally,” Gile said, unbothered, continued to jot notes in her little pad. 

She turned and knocked on the door. The sound echoed, signaling the end. 

“Tell Cray I said hello,” Tim muttered one last dig as the trio of agents returned, zip ties and black hood in hand.
