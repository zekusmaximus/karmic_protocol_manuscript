When she got home that evening Cheryl’s eyes widened as she surveyed the transformed garage loft. She’d hoped Bud might manage the garbage and dishes, possibly even tackling the laundry, but she hadn’t expected this. Usually, he’d be buried in work all weekend. 

“Pretty good, huh?” Bud said, a hint of pride in his voice. 

“Perhaps too good, Mr. Turner,” she replied, narrowing her eyes playfully. “Did you have help?” 

Bud’s expression faltered, then softened as he nodded. “I had the most bizarre visitor while you were gone.” 

“Really?” Cheryl asked, her brow arching in suspicion. “Bizarre as in hired through an app?” 

He laughed, the tension in his shoulders easing. “No, but I probably should have thought of that.” Cheryl adjusted George in her arms and settled into one of the chairs, curiosity deepening her gaze. 

“So, who then?” 

“Georgia Sato, that former CEO who was behind manufacturing the protocol.” Bud said, as if that explained everything. 

Cheryl’s eyes narrowed again, this time with genuine concern. “You had a woman over here while I was gone?” 

“She came to be of service,” Bud replied with a shrug, the absurdity of it not lost on him. 

Cheryl’s tense expression softened into a smile, a teasing light in her eyes. “I guess I should be grateful the service was just loft cleaning.” She winked, but her curiosity only grew. 

“Georgia Sato is a businesswoman,” Bud explained, searching her face for recognition. “You might’ve seen her in the news. Homeland Security raided her factory a while back, thought it was connected to the karmic protocol.” 

“I thought you stepped away from that mess,” she said, recalling how O’Hearn, with his brash, authoritarian ways, had bulldozed over everything. The thought of him made her shudder; she’d always disliked him and had been relieved when pregnancy became a convenient excuse to avoid Bud’s dreary work events. 

“I did,” Bud confirmed, the weight of it evident in his voice. “That’s what made it so strange when she showed up out of nowhere.” 

“So, she just showed up?” Cheryl echoed, disbelief creeping into her tone. “Out of the blue? What did she want, besides, you know, ‘helping’?” 

Bud took a breath, considering how much to say. “She’s used the protocol,” he admitted, watching as confusion flitted across Cheryl’s face. “I think she just wanted to reassure me it was safe,, put my mind at ease, in a way.” 

“Did she?” Cheryl asked, her voice softer now. “Put your mind at ease?” 

Bud nodded slowly. “She did.” 

“Well, I guess that’s good,” she said, the words cautious. Her gaze wandered around the loft, taking in the order Georgia had helped bring to it. “And we got a clean and organized loft out of the deal.” She smiled, but her expression shifted as she thought of the news coverage, the mounting tension around the protocol’s spread. “We’re not in any trouble, are we? With her stopping by and all?” 

Bud’s eyes met hers, steady and reassuring. “Not at all,” he said. “If anything, we’re farther from it now.”
