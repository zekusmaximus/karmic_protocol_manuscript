Carly couldn’t help but think how perfect the fall day was as she walked along one of the many trails winding through the woods at Jeta’s Grove. A cloudless sky allowed the sun to filter through the now-bare branches, warming her face in intermittent patches. The babbling of a brook somewhere nearby added a soothing background to the chorus of bird calls. Cool air invigorated her lungs as she took a deep breath. 

The path ahead was swept clear of leaves, a meticulous touch that must have been done earlier that morning. High winds had rattled through the grove the night before, scattering foliage that now lay piled beyond the trail’s edge. Carly glanced back, noting the path behind was equally pristine. 

As she approached a small clearing, her eyes caught on an old wooden bench nestled beneath a towering oak. It looked as if it had been there for years, possibly placed by the former owner of the land. She felt a sudden urge to sit, to let the peacefulness of the day sink in and soothe her restless mind. 

Settling onto the bench, Carly gazed absently down the clear trail, realizing she must have been lost in her own thoughts for quite some time. She closed her eyes, inhaling deeply to center herself, the crispness of the air sharp and refreshing as it filled her lungs. 

When she opened her eyes again, the gentle attempt at focus fell short as her thoughts trickled back, unbidden. A small, resigned smile tugged at her lips. She liked to think of her thoughts as uninvited guests she’d learned not to chase away too hastily. Experience taught her that forcing them out only made them linger longer. 

There was no shortage of thoughts to entertain, either. Life had been a whirlwind since the protocol became public. Here, in the tranquility of Jeta’s Grove, was the first time she’d managed to catch her breath. Yet her mind, ever analytical, turned the events like a puzzle she could solve if only she examined it closely enough. Understanding what had happened, piecing it together logically felt like the key to knowing what to do next. 

A familiar tension tightened her chest as memories surfaced. The day the agents arrived at the retreat center felt as vivid now as it had then. Anxiety stirred easily, summoned by the memory of their sudden presence. Her conversation with Agent Gile played back in her head, the words she’d spoken, and those she’d deliberately left unsaid. The drive with Ed and the agents to the Homeland Security office came back in startling clarity: the scenery blurring by the window, the sun cutting sharp angles into the car, the strained silence.  

Carly focused on her breath as memories of Ed’s questioning resurfaced. The interview was formal, professional, and probing. Carly couldn’t shake the feeling that the agents were concealing how much they knew; the pointed, almost strategic nature of their questions hinted at an agenda. They delved into Ed’s background, his life before and after the protocol, life at the retreat center, and the reasons behind his decision to stay. The line of inquiry extended to what he had been doing in the time since. His responses were straightforward, unwaveringly honest, but Carly noticed how each answer seemed to irritate the agents, as if they were hoping for a revelation that would slot neatly into a narrative they had already constructed around the protocol. The frustration in their eyes was palpable. 

A wave of sadness washed over her as she recalled the temporary closure of the retreat center, a decision that had been mutual once news of the cease-and-desist order and raid spread. She glanced around Jeta’s Grove, the trees and open spaces offering a momentary sense of peace. Gratitude swelled within her; at least this place could still shelter the full-time meditators. Some of them, she knew, had nowhere else to turn. Many had been preparing for the protocol, only for those plans to evaporate in the wake of uncertainty. Starting from scratch seemed impossible, especially without their notes or prototypes, despite the technical lifting of the cease-and-desist. 

Her mind shifted to the memory of the botched raid at Georgia Sato’s tablet computer facility, a moment that brought an unexpected flicker of satisfaction. Carly felt a touch of guilt at the joy the thought sparked. She knew this feeling was unskillful, a reaction rooted in the simmering resentment she harbored over the unjust intrusion on their peaceful retreat center. The laugh that bubbled up caught her by surprise, unskillful as it was, but it felt oddly liberating. Shaking her head, she reflected on the series of interviews and statements she’d given afterward. Those had been composed, deliberate, and measured, though they still carried the bitter undertone of that fateful day at the retreat center. 

Straightening herself, Carly stood from the little bench and resumed her walk. Gratitude welled up within her for Jeta’s Grove, for the way it had embraced her when the relentless stream of press and attorneys had finally begun to fade. She needed this pause, this peace. It was what she had always envisioned, not just for herself, but for the entire world. The retreat center, the protocol, it had all been for that purpose: to bring insight and wisdom to a world drowning in commercialism, fear and anger. So blinded by those forces, she thought, that when faced with the possibility of true understanding, the world’s best response had been to send agents to shut it down. 

A small smile formed as she realized her thoughts had circled back to where they began. She focused her eyes a few feet ahead on the path and returned her attention to her breath, the cool air entering her nostrils, the warm air leaving her mouth. She felt each step press into the earth beneath her, the gentle breeze brushing against the back of her neck.
