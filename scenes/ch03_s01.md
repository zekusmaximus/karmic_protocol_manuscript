After lunch, Tim swung by the retreat center and found Zach bent over his desk, surrounded by scattered papers and schematics. Tim leaned against the edge of the desk, arms crossed, eyes scanning the disarray. Tension twisted in his chest; Zach looked worn out, his face marked by lines of fatigue. The silence between them was taut, their earlier conversation about the future of the protocol having stalled. Neither wanted to confront the fears simmering unspoken. 

“We’re close,” Tim said quietly, his voice carrying the weight of exhaustion that clung to him like a shadow. His gaze shifted to the meditation mala beads on the desk, Michael’s beads. They seemed to pulse with unspoken memories. “But every time I think about what comes next… I just can’t shake this feeling.” His voice wavered, and he glanced at Zach before his eyes settled on the beads again. “I keep thinking about Michael.” 

Zach’s head snapped up, “Tim…” 

Tim swallowed hard, the familiar pressure of grief threatening to surface. “He came here at the end, you know, before the overdose. He was trying so hard to find peace. I thought I could help him. I thought meditation and everything I’d learned would be enough to pull him back from that darkness.” His voice cracked, and he blinked against the sting in his eyes. “But it wasn’t. I wasn’t enough.” 

The air between them shifted, the pain palpable. Zach’s expression softened, guilt gnawing at Tim’s gut as he caught the empathy in Zach’s eyes. “You can’t blame yourself for that,” Zach said, his voice low and steady. “You did everything you could.” 

Tim’s throat tightened, and he shook his head. Vision clouded with memories and what-ifs. “But what if the protocol had been there then? What if I’d found the key sooner? He could have been saved. This headset could have burned through all that karma weighing him down. He’d still be here.” The ache in his chest surged, raw and unforgiving. 

Zach leaned forward, and Tim caught the way his friend’s shoulders tensed, as if holding back his own memories. “I get it,” Zach said, a tremor breaking through the calm in his voice. “I’ve lost people too. Friends. Colleagues. Some to their own battles, others to the obsession with work. This thing we’re creating, it’s powerful. But I don’t want it to cost us more lives. I don’t want to lose anyone else to it.” 

The room seemed smaller, the silence between them became heavier. Tim looked down, his voice barely a whisper. “I don’t want to lose anyone either.” 

For the first time, the silence seemed to bridge the distance between them, shared regrets weaving through the unspoken pain. The enormity of what they had accomplished loomed in Tim’s mind, no longer just about the groundbreaking technology but the people they had cherished and lost, and the ones they still had a chance to save.
