“Come,” Tim said, motioning him to follow. They made their way down the corridor toward the front of the building, where they stepped into a room that bristled with quiet tension. Screens glowed with feeds from security cameras that monitored the perimeter and the main floor. Two women sat at a control panel, eyes darting between monitors, fingers poised. 

“Everything set?” Tim asked. 

“Sure thing,” one of the women replied, focus unbroken. “We’ll be ready.” 

Tim motioned for Zach to follow him to a table tucked into the far corner of the room. Zach’s mind raced, trying to piece together what they were preparing for as he watched Tim settle into a chair. 

“I have to make a small confession, Zach,” Tim said, his tone serious. 

Zach let out a short laugh, a half-hearted attempt to diffuse the sudden tension. “That’s for sure!” 

Tim didn’t react to the joke. “Remember when you said they’d seized all five of the working prototypes from the retreat center?” 

“Yes,” Zach replied slowly, his brow furrowing as he tried to predict where this was leading. 

Without another word, Tim reached into a nearby box and pulled out a headset. The number “5” was etched on its side. 

Zach’s eyes widened in recognition. “Finn!” he blurted out, the realization dawning that they had deceived him that day when he’d thought the fifth headset was missing. 

“Bingo,” Tim confirmed, placing the prototype carefully on the table. His expression softened. “I’m sorry I didn’t bring you in on this from the beginning.” 

Zach felt a wave of relief mixed with something deeper, an understanding. He raised a hand, dismissing the apology. “No, Tim. You were right not to.” 

Tim’s face clouded with regret. “I’m sorry you’re the one taking the brunt of all this.” 

The weight of that truth pressed down on Zach’s chest. He sighed, the reality of his situation crashing back into his mind. His career, his reputation, everything had been upended. 

Tim’s voice broke the silence, lower now, almost uncertain. “The truth is, I might have exaggerated my familiarity and expertise when it comes to programming this AI,” he admitted, eyes dropping to the table. 

Zach leaned back slightly, absorbing the implication. “You need me to program the artificial intelligence that will run all of these.” 

Tim’s head moved side to side, a wry smile appearing. “I could probably program them, sure. But not efficiently, and definitely not without mistakes.” 

“You might not believe this,” Zach said, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips, “but aside from having nothing to do until my first court date, I’ve actually had a plan for this knocking around my head for quite a while.” 

Tim’s eyes lit up. “Now you’re talking! I know you didn’t bring along an overnight bag, but given the circumstances, it might be best if you stay here with us, if you don’t mind a cot.” 

A tired laugh escaped Zach. “A cot never sounded so good,” he said just as Finn walked in, his expression a mix of relief and unease. 

“Did you break the news to him?” Finn asked, his voice low, eyes darting away. 

Tim nodded. “Yes.” 

Zach stood up and gave him a nod. “You pulled it off,” he said, extending a hand. “I knew I wasn’t losing my mind.” 

Finn’s grin was sheepish as he shook Zach’s hand. “We were just lucky number five wasn’t scheduled to be used anytime soon. It’s good to see you.” 

He stepped forward, a lopsided smile breaking through as he clasped Zach’s hand. “Looks like you’re officially a dharmapala now.” 

“A what?” Zach asked, the unfamiliar word tugging at his curiosity. 

“A guardian of the dharma,” Tim interjected, a subtle pride in his tone. “That’s what our little band started calling themselves.” 

“Dharmapala,” Zach repeated, savoring the sound. The name resonated somewhere deep within him, sparking an unexpected warmth. “I like the ring of that.” 

Before the moment could settle, an alarm blared, sharp and intrusive, cutting through the room like a knife. The monitors went dark, the sudden blackness twisting Zach’s gut. A second later, the screens blinked back on, lines of static resolving into the familiar array of video feeds. 

“We have movement at the perimeter,” one of the women monitoring security called out, her chair rolling back as she gestured to the main feed. Zach’s eyes locked onto the screen showing several black vehicles racing toward the gate, now ominously ajar. 

A chill ran down his spine. Whatever was coming, it wouldn’t be good.
