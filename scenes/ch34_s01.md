Georgia Sato opened the box and lifted out the headset. The February morning light streamed through her office windows, casting a warm glow over the polished surface of her desk. A small, folded sheet of instructions slipped to the floor as she admired the craftsmanship. She bent down to retrieve it, a soft chuckle escaping her lips when she noticed the single word emblazoned on the top fold. 

“Awaken.” The sight of it made her smile wryly. She remembered the long debates over what that single word should be. From “end your suffering” to “be here now” to the stark, abrupt “wake up.” 

Georgia unfolded the paper slowly, her eyes tracing the bold instructions laid out before her. Set aside your preconceptions. Find a comfortable place where you can sit for an hour or so undisturbed. Place the headset comfortably over your eyes. Adjust the earpieces so they are snug. Breathe. Press the button on the left side of the headset. Relax. 

She flipped the paper over, noticing how ‘Awaken’ had been printed in each corner, ensuring visibility no matter how it was refolded. In the center, her gaze settled on the final message, obviously meant to be read after the user had followed the instructions on the first side. You are Awake. You have completed the Karmic Protocol. The program has reset itself and is ready for its next user. 

A quiet sense of finality washed over her as she refolded the paper and set it back on the table. She picked up the headset again, running her fingers over the button on one side and the faintly etched ‘KP’ on the other. The lightness of it surprised her; so much intricate technology encapsulated in something so simple. The adjustable, padded straps and earpieces spoke of careful design, of meticulous intent. She couldn’t help but feel a surge of admiration. 

Holding the headset, a thrill coursed through her, a sharp, electric anticipation. This was it: the algorithm to enlightenment, tangible and ready, promising to peel back the veils that had cloaked her mind for so long. 

Georgia set it down gently, letting herself breathe deeply. Everything was in order, or as in order as it would ever be. The reins of her responsibilities had been passed on, the necessary papers signed, the accounts balanced. 

Tim’s words echoed in her mind: enlightenment was inevitable for everyone; it was only a matter of timing. And here it was for her, here she stood, staring down at it in this moment. One more button to press, one more step. This would be her last incarnation. A wistful ache surfaced as she wished her grandfather could be beside her, sharing this journey. 

Memories of conversations with Ed, her long meditations, even moments of whispered prayers, surfaced unbidden. Her grandfather would be proud; she felt that in the depths of her being. The words of the Buddha drifted back to her: “Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task is done. There is nothing further for this world.” 

A profound serenity bloomed within her, soft and overwhelming, bringing tears to her eyes. 

Getting up, Georgia dimmed the lights in her home office. There was no longer any need to wait, no need to strive, no need to suffer. Inevitability had found her. She placed the headset on, adjusting it until she was enveloped in complete darkness, reminding herself not to forget to breathe. Her fingers found the button on the side, the touch familiar and final, and she pressed it.
