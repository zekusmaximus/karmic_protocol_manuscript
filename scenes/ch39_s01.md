“Hello, Agent Gile, this is Jessica Everett, from Senator Yost’s office. I was hoping to talk with you off-the-record about the Senator’s upcoming testimony. If you could call me back at your earliest convenience, I would appreciate it.” 

Gile erased the message with a flick of her thumb, agita sinking deeper in her chest. She glanced up from her phone, meeting her partner’s expectant eyes across the cluttered desk. 

“Anything on Sato?” she asked, her voice steady, betraying no hint of the frustration simmering inside. 

“Not a thing,” he responded. He resumed typing, his expression shifting back to the detached focus she’d come to expect from him. 

Gile’s jaw tightened. No leads, no angles, just the void Sato had left behind. It was like she’d vanished into thin air. She stole another look at her phone, the call from Yost’s office gnawing at her. It felt like a long shot, but maybe, just maybe, they had something.
