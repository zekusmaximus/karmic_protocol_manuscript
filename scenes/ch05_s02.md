Driving from the office that night, Zach felt the weight of certainty settle in his chest. He knew exactly why the government would want to ban a virtual reality platform. The retreat center was already abuzz with talk of mass production, and with five headsets now operational, it was only a matter of time before the protocol found its way into the open. The thought made his stomach tighten with worry. Maybe he could use his upcoming speech at the convention to shift attention away from the protocol or even make a case against it? But that would be dangerous. Since he’d be speaking as a representative of his company, everyone would analyze his words carefully—the legal department would review them first, then the association would examine them, and Bud would probably scrutinize every sentence too. 

Bud. Something about him didn’t sit right with Zach. On the surface, Bud was the epitome of a genuine guy, earnest and a true believer in technology. But that very sincerity set Zach’s instincts on edge. Why didn’t anyone have anything negative to say about him? Bud had requested this meeting around the time the protocol proved successful, why did the timing of this meeting request line up so conveniently? Zach clenched the steering wheel a bit tighter. He’d pushed off the meeting as long as possible, but Bud’s persistence had been relentless. 

He tried to piece it together as the car hummed along. The retreat center was insulated; no one there would know Bud, he reminded himself, aware he was spiraling. But Bud had connections, a web of colleagues and acquaintances. If a hint of the protocol had escaped, a whispered rumor passed from one friend to another, it wouldn’t be implausible for it to find its way to Bud. Especially if someone in his circles thought it interesting enough to mention, even in passing. 

Zach’s focus snapped back as he turned into the parking lot of the spa. He exhaled slowly, trying to clear his mind. The phone in the passenger seat caught his eye, and he slid it into his briefcase as the car glided into a spot. He had arrived early for his appointment, but his thoughts refused to relent, circling, and prodding at him as he sat there. 

He turned his attention to the technical details of the protocol. He sifted through the complex layers, focusing on how quantum physics affected living brain cells. Suddenly, the design of the protocol snapped into clear focus. He could see it all now like a blueprint spreading out in his mind. This wasn’t just collecting brain data—it was creating a bridge between quantum physics and biology that could maintain special  states in the brain. 

The system combined several cutting-edge technologies. It merged regular EEG brain monitoring with quantum sensors to track not just normal brainwaves but also brain activity at the quantum level. Scientists had already mapped meditation states using EEG readings and brain wave patterns, but the protocol went much deeper. It could detect quantum connections in the tiny structures inside neurons. The protocol was mapping a hidden symphony of brain activity that even the top researchers in the field had barely started to understand. 

What made it revolutionary was the feedback system. The retinal tracking was observing eye movement and quantum coherence states in the visual cortex. At the same time, it was mapping neural oscillation patterns. It resulted in a wide range of user experiences. Some describing vivid visuals, others distinct sounds, and still others perceiving subtle energy shifts. The variability intrigued him and reinforced that this technology was unprecedented.

He marveled how Buddhism, once dismissed as mere philosophy, served as a precise roadmap for consciousness. The quantum sensors validated those ancient teachings. Charting states of awareness were previously spoken in esoteric terms. This wasn’t manipulation at all. It was the creation of conditions for consciousness to observe itself at the quantum level. 

A chill ran down his spine as he thought about the implications. Not everyone was prepared to relinquish those illusions. For those deeply attached to desire and power, the truth the protocol exposed would be terrifying. 

His thoughts darkened. This protocol wouldn’t just change how individuals think. It could shake the foundations of a world that runs on buying things and controlling people. He imagined politicians, corporations, and news outlets panicking, their voices rising in alarm. They would call it dangerous—not because it actually was, but because it threatened the systems they depended on. A society freed from endless wanting could tear down the very structures that held our current world together. What scared him most was thinking about the chaos that would come from those who refused to wake up, who would fight desperately to protect their familiar illusions. 

The first sting of tears pricked at the corners of Zach’s eyes, but the sudden buzz of his phone from within his briefcase interrupted the moment. His alarm. It was time for his scheduled float in the sensory deprivation tank. This spa boasted the quietest, most comfortable tanks he had ever found, and he often looked forward to the experience, two hours of weightless silence and darkness that unknotted his body and set his mind adrift. But now, as he sat there, the thought gnawed at him. Did he really want to be submerged in that silent, consuming dark, alone with this fear?
