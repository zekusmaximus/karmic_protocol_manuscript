The news anchor’s voice resonated through the room. “A factory in the middle of livestreaming a tour for children receiving free computers from the tablets-for-tots program was mistakenly raided this week by Homeland Security,” she announced, holding up one of the colorful tablets. 

Tim barely registered the heat wave of August 2027 that had reportedly added to the agents’ discomfort. It was the implications that caught his attention. 

Tim’s gaze flicked to the screen as the anchor continued, “Here in studio with us today is Ms. Georgia Sato, a benefactor of the program and owner of the factory who happened to be present during the botched raid, and State Senator Steven Yost, who was accompanying the class from his district on the tour. Georgia, Senator, good morning.” 

“Good morning,” they both replied. Tim noted the tension in Senator Yost’s stance as he leaned forward. 

“Homeland Security has tried to paint this as an honest mistake, but you have a different take, don’t you, Senator?” the anchor pressed. 

Tim leaned forward slightly. 

“Yes, I do,” the Senator said. “This was apparently the third raid by Homeland Security over this karmic protocol. The fact that they had raided a property in my district, formerly owned and donated to meditation teachers by Ms. Sato, makes it extremely hard for me to believe this was anything but a targeted attempt to entrap or discredit her. We have here an incredibly successful businesswoman, daughter of immigrants to our country, practicing and supporting her spiritual beliefs, giving back through many programs like tablets-for-tots, and this is how she is treated?” 

Tim’s eyes flickered to Georgia Sato, who, despite the strain in her smile, projected calm. She spoke with the ease of someone accustomed to public scrutiny. “The federal government and Homeland Security in particular are tasked with keeping us safe. I admire and applaud their hard-working agents who have neutralized so many credible threats over the years.” 

Tim felt a subtle shift in the room as both the anchor and the Senator nodded. He glanced at Zach, who raised an eyebrow in acknowledgment of the underlying tension. 

“However,” Georgia continued, her voice soft but steely, “my understanding, given what Senator Yost and his colleagues have been able to dig up since this last raid, is that several agencies of the federal administration seem to be colluding, targeting, and eradicating a particular program that aids in meditation. If it weren’t for the livestream happening that day, this, well, let’s call it what it is, manhunt, likely would have gone unnoticed and ended up doing real harm, damage to our trust in our government, instead of just scaring the bejeezus out of a group of darling children.” 

Tim’s jaw tightened at the word “manhunt.” The implications were becoming clearer, and the stakes higher. 

“Homeland Security will not release any facts about this operation, nor state what exactly the threat to national security is that they trying to stop,” the Senator added, his voice rising with each word. 

Tim noted how the anchor shifted slightly, as if bracing for the transition. She nodded to the Senator and then faced the camera. “Well, we know the cease-and-desist and warrant were targeting a virtual reality program called the karmic protocol. What do we know about that? Senator Yost and Ms. Sato will be joined by Carly Rice from the retreat center that invented it here for the next segment. Don’t go anywhere!” 

As the broadcast cut to commercial, Tim exchanged a look with Zach, a knowing smile passing between them. An extended exhale followed, broken only when Zach glanced down at his phone and muttered, “Bronski’s texting. He’s eager for our second meeting.” 

Tim’s eyes flicked back to the screen as the program resumed, his mind already racing with possibilities. 

“Welcome back. We’re discussing the recent Homeland Security raids with Senator Steven Yost, Georgia Sato, and Carly Rice from the retreat center that invented what’s being called the ‘karmic protocol.’ Ms. Rice, can you tell us exactly what this protocol is and why the government seems so intent on seizing it?” The host’s voice filled the room with practiced neutrality. 

Tim watched Carly straighten in her chair. The flicker of hesitation in her eyes vanished, replaced by a calm resolve. “The protocol is a meditation aid that uses virtual reality and artificial intelligence to help people recognize the true nature of their own consciousness. It’s completely voluntary, non-invasive, and has been successful in every documented case of proper use.” 

Tim’s focus sharpened as the host leaned in, sensing an opportunity. “Successful in what way?” she asked. 

“In helping people achieve what Buddhist traditions would call enlightenment; what neuroscience might call a permanent shift in default consciousness,” Carly said. Her words were measured, carrying a quiet defiance. “The government’s response has been, frankly, overwrought. They’re treating a meditation tool like it’s some kind of weapon.” 

Tim shifted in his seat, catching the slight tension in the Senator’s jaw as the host turned to him. “Senator Yost, did you have any knowledge of this technology being developed in your district?” 

“None whatsoever,” Yost admitted. “My first introduction to the protocol was through news reports of these increasingly aggressive federal raids. What concerns me is the pattern of targeting Ms. Sato’s properties without clear probable cause.” 

Tim’s eyes darted to Georgia Sato, who remained poised. “Ms. Sato, your company’s facility was the latest target. Were you manufacturing this protocol?” the host asked. 

“The facility produces educational tablets for underprivileged children,” Georgia said smoothly, her voice betraying nothing. Tim knew her public statements were always well-practiced. “While I have supported the retreat center’s general mission through charitable donations, I have no direct knowledge of or involvement with the protocol’s development.” 

Tim’s mind raced, piecing together what Georgia left unsaid. He remembered the meticulous shipments, the strategic partnerships that had been whispered about in tech circles. Georgia had been careful, deliberate. The factory’s operations, those shipments of electronic components and the labyrinthine paperwork, had been more than legitimate; they’d been a shield, a way to mask the true purpose behind the enterprise. 

The children’s tablet program, he reflected, was both a noble cause and an impeccable cover. Everything from the bulk orders of display panels to specialized testing equipment made sense on paper. But beneath that surface, a second, concealed production line had been taking form. It was all done with such precision that even Tim marveled at the level of deception. 

“Ms. Rice,” the host said, pulling Tim back to the present, “Homeland Security claims this is an unlicensed medical device that poses risks to users. How do you respond?”

“The protocol is not a medical device. It’s a tool for consciousness exploration, no different in principle from traditional meditation techniques. We’ve documented no adverse effects, and in fact, users report improved mental health, emotional regulation and life satisfaction,” Carly said, her tone unwavering.

Tim could sense the host’s skepticism before she voiced it. “Yet you kept its development secret?”

“We were careful and methodical in our testing, yes. But now that the government has forced this into the open, we’ll be formally challenging the cease-and-desist order. The protocol works. It’s safe. And people have a right to use it if they choose.”

“Even if it fundamentally alters their consciousness?” the host pressed.

“Especially then,” Carly replied with a slight smile. “We alter our consciousness every day through education, through meditation, through exercise, through prayer. The protocol simply makes that process more efficient. It’s like AI has made coding more efficient. The government’s reaction reveals more about their fears than any actual danger from the technology.”

The host leaned forward. “And if the cease-and-desist is lifted?” 

“We have decided to cease all activities at our retreat center in the wake of this government intrusion,” Carly said simply, her voice carrying the weight of finality. “We hope there will be no more secrets, no more hiding. It’s time for transparency not only about what this technology can offer humanity, but why the government is apparently so opposed to it.” 

Senator Yost’s nod seemed almost rehearsed, while Georgia’s face held its polished neutrality. But it was Carly’s composed confidence that captured Tim’s attention. She spoke like someone who knew which side of history she was on, and that knowledge, Tim realized, might be the most powerful tool she possessed.
