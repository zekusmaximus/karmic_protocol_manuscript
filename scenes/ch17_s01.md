Zach swiped his keycard again at the back entrance to his office, the small beep echoing in the quiet alley. He was late again, and walking through the main foyer always felt like announcing it to the world. The locked door didn’t budge, even after a third swipe. A tight knot formed in his stomach. Was the card malfunctioning? He inspected it closely, but nothing looked out of the ordinary. 

“Mr. Goodman,” a voice interrupted. Zach flinched slightly and turned to see a security guard rounding the corner. 

“Yes,” he said, holding up his keycard with a forced, questioned smile. “It’s not working.” 

The guard’s eyes flicked briefly to Zach’s face before stepping forward and swiping his own card. The door clicked open on the first try. “Your keycard has been disabled. Please come with me,” the guard said, his tone unreadable as he held the door open. 

Zach’s pulse quickened. He nodded, stepping inside, his feet moving reluctantly as he noticed another guard standing just inside the corridor. “What’s this about?” he asked, trying to keep his voice steady, even as an uneasy chill traced down his spine. 

“Chairman O’Hearn and Mr. Perez will explain,” the guard said, giving nothing more. He motioned Zach forward, and the second guard led the way to the elevator. 

Zach’s mind raced, his thoughts darting between possibilities. Why would Perez, the CEO himself, need to see him? The knot in his stomach twisted tighter as the elevator ascended, stopping at the top floor. 

The lead guard pushed the suite door open, gesturing for Zach to step inside. He walked through, noticing the receptionist already poised by Perez’s office door. She nodded, her expression neutral but eyes flicking with something he couldn’t read. “They’re waiting for you, Mr. Goodman,” she said. 

“Thanks, Carol,” Zach murmured, the words catching in his throat as he stepped past her. Inside, Matt Perez sat at the head of the polished table, flanked by Chairman Frank O’Hearn and Guy Whitman, the head of security. A fourth man in an impeccably tailored suit, unfamiliar to Zach, sat across from them. Guy approached and, without a word, took Zach’s laptop from his backpack, setting it on Matt’s desk before indicating the empty chair for him. 

“Zach,” Matt began, his voice steady but devoid of warmth. “There’s no easy way to say this, but I wanted you to hear it from me directly. Your employment has been terminated, effective this morning.” 

Zach stared, disbelief paralyzing him for a moment. “Fired? On what grounds?” The question slipped out before he could process it. His gaze darted around the table, finally landing on the stranger. “And who is this?” 

Matt’s expression didn’t change as he said, “This is Agent Fiona Gile from the Department of Homeland Security. She’s here to consult on an investigation into the misappropriation of company assets.” 

“Homeland Security? What exactly am I supposed to have stolen, Matt?” Zach’s voice rose, the tension breaking through despite his best efforts to stay calm. “You’ve known me for how long?” 

“Let’s all calm down,” Frank interjected, raising his hands in a placated gesture. The smugness in his eyes said otherwise. “We have reason to believe that you’ve been stealing company intellectual property and sharing it with outside interests.” 

“Reason to believe?” Zach echoed, incredulity sharpening his tone. This was surreal. “What outside interests?” 

Frank’s smile widened, his eyes glinting with satisfaction. “Do you not sit on the board of a meditation center that’s been clandestinely developing virtual reality content?” 

“Clandestinely? What is that supposed to imply?” Zach felt a wave of heat rush over him, making it hard to think. He drew in a deep breath, trying to force some composure back into his fraying thoughts. 

Matt shifted, shooting Frank a brief look before focusing back on Zach. “Zach, we have credible evidence that intellectual property—code, schematics, even hardware—has been diverted to the Karmic Protocol project. You must know we monitor all company emails, messaging services, and laptops….” 

Zach sagged back into his chair, the weight of the accusation pressing down on him. He exhaled slowly, frustration coursing through him. This was a setup, an elaborate one. Not a single piece of their so-called proprietary code, not one half-baked idea, and certainly not any component of their hardware had made its way into his project. 

Across the table, Frank’s grin deepened as he slid a termination notice toward Zach. Zach’s pulse throbbed in his ears. Why was Frank O’Hearn, the Chairman of the board, here for a termination meeting? He hadn’t shown interest in operations like this before. Zach’s mind darted back, grasping for the last time he’d seen Frank, at the virtual reality conference. And then it hit him. 

“Bud Turner,” Zach muttered as he slid the notice closer to read it. Of course, it was Turner, who else could have pieced it all together and secured Frank’s ear? It had been Turner who persuaded Carly to send Tim to the conference, setting everything in motion. 

“Excuse me?” Agent Gile leaned forward, narrowing her eyes as she strained to catch Zach’s words. 

Zach’s gaze snapped to the agent. “Oh no,” he said sharply, pointing at Gile, “without a warrant and my lawyer, I have nothing to say to you.” The moment the words left his mouth, regret prickled at him. The shift in the room was immediate: glances exchanged, subtle nods, an unspoken confirmation of their suspicions. His stomach churned as he realized he still didn’t fully grasp why Homeland Security was involved. Even if every accusation was true, how did it warrant the attention of a federal agency? 

With a controlled motion, Zach tossed his keycard onto the table and slipped the folded termination notice into his jacket pocket. “Is that it?” He turned to Guy Whitman. “I assume your team will be escorting me out now?” 

“That pleasure will be mine,” Guy said, already rising from his seat. 

Zach’s mind whirled, questions tangling as Guy led him out to the elevator and through the front foyer. He felt the eyes of colleagues prickling against him, whispers starting to bubble in his wake. Keeping his expression neutral, he focused inward, grappling with the sequence of events. 

Bud Turner had maneuvered Frank O’Hearn into his corner, who then must have convinced Matt Perez that Zach had funneled company resources into developing the Karmic Protocol. But what baffled Zach most was how Turner and O’Hearn had managed to convince Homeland Security that the protocol posed an actual threat to national security. 

The door clicked shut behind him as he stepped outside, the chill of reality settling on his skin. Heading toward his car, an unsettling realization flickered in his mind. He did worry that the protocol was a threat, not necessarily to national security, but to an economy built on normal human desire. Maybe, he thought grimly, in a democracy teetering under the weight of its dependencies, an economic threat could be viewed as a national security issue. 

The following days blurred by, a storm of frantic calls to lawyers and ignoring the flood of messages from reporters. Despite himself, Zach couldn’t stop checking his phone, though he wasn’t sure what he expected to find. When Joe Bronski’s email finally came through, with its carefully worded questions about neural network architecture, Zach recognized it instantly, a lifeline back to the world he had been yanked away from.
