“Call Constance Henning,” Bud said, his voice taut as he turned to the video screen. He sank into his chair, the weight of the revelation pressing down on him. So, the headsets were in production after all. Questions buzzed in his mind: How many had they made? Where were they going? Was there still anyone in the administration with enough resolve to stop this? 

The screen flickered, and Constance’s face appeared, sharp and poised. “Bud,” she greeted him, her tone guarded. “Hello. I take it this isn’t a social call.” 

“No, Commissioner, it most certainly is not,” Bud replied, rubbing a hand across his face. “And I wish I could blame my paranoia on a lack of sleep.” 

“Bud Turner,” Constance said, a hint of dry amusement softening her voice, “what in the world do you have to be paranoid about?” 

“It’s Mulvaney,” he said, pausing as the knot in his stomach tightened. “And probably Goodman. Maybe even Sato, for all I know.” 

Her expression shifted, brows knitting as she exhaled sharply. “The protocol,” she muttered. “I knew we weren’t done with that, despite our best efforts.” 

“They’ve gone and done it,” Bud said, his voice low and bitter. “I’m almost certain they’ve mass-produced it.” 

Constance’s eyes narrowed. “What makes you say that?” 

“Tim Mulvaney personally delivered one to my house this morning,” Bud said, his voice tight. He braced for the silence that followed. “It’s not some prototype, either. It has a logo etched on it, a sleek design, and even comes with printed instructions.” 

A longer pause settled between them. Bud could almost hear the gears turning in Constance’s mind. 

“That changes things,” she said finally. “Do you have plans for studying it, or using it, or would you bring it in?” 

Plans? The thought hadn’t crystallized in his mind yet. Destroying it would be useless if more were out there, landing on doorsteps just like his. He clenched his jaw. “My company has no interest in it; besides, I don’t need my techs getting any ideas. I’ll bring it in.” 

It was the right call. It’s possible the administration could discover the headsets’ creation process and location. Bud’s thoughts churned, grappling with the implications until Constance’s voice cut through. 

“Good. I’m afraid Cray and his goon squad are going to have a field day when this breaks. Have you told anyone else?” she asked, her tone sharp. 

Bud exhaled slowly. “I called you as soon as I looked it over and read the personal note Mulvaney delivered with it.” 

“Hence your paranoia,” she said, a hint of irony in her voice. “Anything bad, useful, or threatening in the note?” 

“No to all of those,” Bud said, his voice steady but weary. “Just a friendly note thanking me for inviting him to speak at the conference.” He hesitated for a moment. “Any idea how Cray is going to react?” 

“Not calmly,” Constance said, her voice flattening. “He’ll be scrambling to save face, and… I’m not supposed to know this, but…” 

The pause was unbearable, tension pulling at Bud’s chest. “Constance, what do you know that you’re not supposed to?” he pressed, trying to keep his voice even. 

“Apparently, Cray has been working with the FDA,” she continued, each word careful, as if weighing their weight aloud. Bud’s pulse quickened. He could feel the pause lengthen. “And I don’t know, maybe Public Health and some of the others. O’Hearn’s been sniffing around too.” 

Bud clenched his jaw. “Yeah, I created a monster there,” he muttered. Memories of the deceit Cray had condoned, at O’Hearn’s prodding, surfaced, the betrayal that fractured their task force and fueled Henning’s drastic actions. 

“When can you be here?” Constance asked, cutting through the silence with urgency. 

Bud glanced at the clock on his desk. “I can come by tonight. How late will you be in?” 

“Oh, I’ll be here,” she said, a trace of fatigue softening her voice. She added with a resigned sigh, “Who knows, perhaps spreading this karmic protocol far and wide won’t be the end of the world. Even enlightened people need to eat and work, right?” 

The attempt at optimism didn’t slip past him. He managed to have a dry smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Right,” he said softly.
