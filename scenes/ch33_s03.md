Through the glass, Sherry’s serene smile sent a chill down Fiona’s spine. The technicians moved around her, checking restraints and monitoring equipment, oblivious to the dissonance that struck Fiona to her core. She’d been part of the task force that brought Sherry in, believing they were protecting society from an unknown danger. Now, doubts crept in, relentless. 

“The protocol’s supporters would say that’s exactly the point,” she found herself said, surprised by the tremor in her voice. “That society needs this kind of transformation.” 

O’Hearn shot her a sharp look, but Trout nodded, her eyes weary but understanding. “They don’t understand that even beneficial changes need to happen gradually. Rapid transformation, even toward something ‘better,’ can tear a society apart.” 

Fiona felt the weight of those words settle in her mind, heavy with truth. 

“Sometimes protection requires prevention,” Cray said quietly. His voice carried an edge of resignation that made Fiona’s chest tighten further. “Even if people don’t understand what they’re being protected from.” 

Trout gathered her files, her expression troubled. Fiona noted the deep lines around the director’s eyes. “They see enlightenment. We see destabilization.” 

“And once those dominoes start falling…” Cray began. 

“Better not to let them fall at all,” Trout finished. 

As the others filed out, Fiona lingered, her gaze locked on Sherry through the glass. The woman’s smile never wavered, an unsettling contrast to the turmoil twisting inside Fiona. Sherry’s expression seemed to hold a secret, knowledge that eluded them all. It was as if she knew something Fiona feared they might never understand or accept. 

“God save us,” she whispered, the words barely audible. But as she stared at Sherry’s peaceful face, a question took root: who needed saving more, Sherry, or them?
