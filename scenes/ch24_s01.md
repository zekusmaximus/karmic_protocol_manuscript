Agent Gile sat in the back of one of the black SUVs racing toward the manufacturing facility. Gile’s gaze swept over the line of vehicles in the caravan, each one blending seamlessly into the mundane. The radio on her shoulder crackled. 

“Zach Goodman was able to lose his tail this morning. There’s a chance he may be at the facility. 

 Gile’s pulse quickened at the news.  

As they neared the front gate, Gile’s eyes narrowed. It was open, which set off a warning deep in her gut. Something wasn’t right. 

“Any unusual traffic in or out this morning?” she asked, keeping her tone even. 

“Box truck went into the loading dock, no visual on what it contained,” came the response. “And one private vehicle, three occupants, one male, two female.” The gender detail seemed irrelevant, but Gile let it slide. 

“Let’s get this over with,” she muttered, signaling the driver to proceed. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught another agent’s nod. They all shared the same unease. At least they wouldn’t need biohazard suits this time, she thought, recalling the nerve-wracking chemical weapon bust in Arizona two years ago.
