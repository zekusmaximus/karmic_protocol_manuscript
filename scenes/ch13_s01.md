Carly watched as more newcomers pushed past the volunteer at the door of the retreat, their voices cutting sharply through the gentle hum of dinner conversation. 

“You can’t keep this to yourselves!” 

Carly shifted forward in her chair, a prickle of unease running down her spine, but Sherry’s hand rested lightly on her arm, halting her. “Let Ed handle it,” Sherry said, her voice soft but firm. 

Ed was already striding towards the entrance. Carly observed how his calm, commanding presence seemed to soothe the tension instantly. Her gaze flicked to the expressions of those around her. The newest arahants watched with serene detachment, their faces untouched by the brewing conflict. In contrast, the long-term residents betrayed subtle signs of unease, tightened jaws, darting glances. The chasm between the awakened and the unawakened had never felt so stark to Carly. 

“The truth,” Ed’s voice rang out, silencing the room with its steady resonance, “is not a possession to be grasped, but a reality to be lived. Please, join us for dinner. We can talk about why you’re really here.” 

Carly’s shoulders loosened as the tension in the room dissipated, the seekers moving hesitantly to the seats offered to them. Yet, a gnawing certainty twisted in her chest. This was only the beginning. “We can’t keep operating like this,” she murmured, leaning closer to Sherry. “Either we find a way to scale up safely, or…” 

“Or the dharma will find its own way,” Sherry interjected, her voice carrying the same serene confidence that always left Carly with an uncomfortable mix of comfort and disquiet. “Perhaps that’s exactly what’s meant to happen.”
