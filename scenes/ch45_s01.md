Cray’s footsteps echoed down the empty hallway, sharp and uneven against the polished marble floor, each tap seeming to underscore the distance from everything familiar. He paused outside his office door, listening as the murmur of aides and lobbyists seeped faintly through the thick oak. 

His hand hovered over the brass handle, fingers twitching with the same tremor that had plagued him for days. He pressed them hard into his palm, trying to force the shaking into submission, but it continued. 

Pushing the door open, he slipped inside, where the muted hum of the city filtered through the tall windows behind his desk. The office was spotless, every document and file in place with his characteristic precision. Yet, as his gaze passed over the familiar details, they felt foreign. 

Cray moved to the window, peering down at the streets below. Cars inched forward like ants, headlights barely cutting through the encroaching dusk. He used to savor this view, the sense of command it gave him, the knowledge that every decision he made reverberated through the lives of those below. But today, the city felt distant, as though slipping beyond his grasp. For the first time, the height didn’t empower him; it reminded him of his own fragility. 

He placed his hand on the windowpane, the cool glass anchoring him momentarily. Exhaling, he watched his breath cloud the surface, then swiped it away with his sleeve, the motion automatic. His phone buzzed in his pocket. Likely O’Hearn, persistent as ever, but he ignored it. Instead, his fingers found a hairline crack in the glass, something he hadn’t noticed before. Pressing his fingertips against it, he tested its strength, noting how it held firm but remained undeniably present. 

Just like everything else in his life, Cray thought. Cracked, but enduring. 

Turning from the window, he crossed the room with a stiffness that felt foreign, each step mechanical. When he reached his desk, his eyes caught on the half-open drawer, where a photo peeked from beneath a stack of briefing papers. He hadn’t looked at it in months, but today, he pulled it free. 

The photograph was worn, its edges frayed from years of handling. His wife’s face beamed up at him, their daughter perched on her hip, her eyes alive with a future he’d once worked tirelessly to protect. He traced his thumb over his wife’s face, his hand trembling. He’d sacrificed for them, long nights, endless meetings, and compromised more times than he cared to remember. But that smile, like the people in the picture, belonged to another time. 

He set the photo face down on the desk, fixing his gaze on it, waiting for something to rise within him, guilt, anger, regret. But only silence came, the same unyielding silence that had filled the Senate chamber that morning as his words fell into the void. 

The committee listened with the practiced politeness of seasoned politicians, nodding in all the right places. But Cray saw it in their eyes, the hesitation, the creeping doubt. And then came the final blow: Senator Yost’s offhanded suggestion to investigate the “potential benefits” of the protocol. The phrase slipped out so easily, but it hit Cray like a gut punch. They were slipping. The tide was turning, and he was powerless to stop it.
