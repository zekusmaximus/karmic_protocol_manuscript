Freeman “Bud” Turner, Director of Government Relations and Community Engagement. The new title resonated in his mind. He handed out another card. Around him, friends and colleagues gathered at the end of the bar, exchanging laughter and clinking glasses.  

Hull’s bar teemed with energy, unusually busy for a Sunday. It was the type of place where professionals brought clients for dinner or stopped by for drinks after work, hoping to run into familiar faces in government, finance and industry. For Bud, Hull’s wasn’t just a favorite spot; it was where business truly got done. It made sense that he was here, celebrating his promotion. 

Bud worked for one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence companies. With the promotion, he now oversaw how it engaged with local communities and governments, from neighborhood associations to Congress. 

Years of navigating bureaucracies and administrations had equipped him well. With a master’s in public affairs and a law degree under his belt, he knew his sharp mind and quick wit made him stand out. Most people seemed to genuinely like him. That last trait was especially useful. Bud’s natural charisma and genuine interest in others made him persuasive in a way that seemed effortless. 

“Congratulations, Director of Government Relations,” Frank O’Hearn said, clinking his glass against Bud’s with a knowing smile.  

Bud’s eyes narrowed. When a Board Chairman from a competing company sought him out at Hull’s, it was rarely a coincidence. 

“Thanks, Frank,” Bud said, studying the older man’s expression as he sipped his drink. 

Frank’s smile hardened at the edges. “Though I’m afraid your first challenge just landed on your desk.” 

Bud tilted his head, feeling a prickle of apprehension. Years in tech regulation had taught him to listen when someone like Frank spoke. 

“The World Health Organization is pushing for neural interface regulations,” Frank continued. “Some bureaucrats in Geneva convinced half the city that consciousness-altering technology needs oversight before it even exists.” He let out a dry laugh. “I trust you’ll help them see how… premature that would be, for the sake of both our companies?” 

Bud’s smile was automatic, though unease coiled inside him. “Of course,” he replied, filing the information away as Frank’s intensity lingered in the air. The industry’s worst fears often came before major leaps in innovation. “Why the urgency for regulation?” he added, unable to ignore the feeling that he was missing a piece of the puzzle. 

Frank’s hand clapped down on Bud’s shoulder, firm but brief. “Let’s just say I’ve seen some interesting patent applications lately. We can’t let bureaucrats strangle innovation in its cradle.” With that, Frank melted back into the crowd. 

Bud exhaled slowly, his mind already tracing the threads of influence he’d need to pull to kill regulations like these. But even as he mapped out phone calls and strategy, an itch of doubt lingered. Why was Frank so invested? Although the entire industry could be effected by the regulations, the man rarely concerned himself with routine regulation battles. 

Cheryl appeared at his side, glass raised. “To you,” she said, eyes twinkling. 

Bud’s chest warmed at her presence, and he slipped an arm around her waist. “And to my wife,” he added, raising his own glass, “who helped me reach where I am today and makes every success worth it.” 

The room hummed with laughter and cheer as Bud kissed Cheryl’s temple. Her smile transported him to a place where the noise and the pressures melted away, leaving only the two of them in a perfect, unbroken moment. He whispered, “I love you,” before they parted to continue mingling, the night unfolding in its usual whirl of conversation and clinks of glass.
