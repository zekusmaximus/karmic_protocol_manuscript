That morning, walking the grounds alone, Georgia Sato reached the small pond where her grandfather used to fish. The moon’s reflection wavered on the dark water, catching her eye as she paused. Memories of sitting here as a child, watching him cast his line with serene patience, surfaced unbidden. He never seemed to care whether he caught anything. 

“The fish are just an excuse,” he told her once. “The real purpose is to sit quietly and watch your mind.” 

She had been too young to understand then. Her father had never understood either, too consumed with building the business empire she now helmed. The estate accounting had valued them at nothing, but to her, they were priceless—a piece of wisdom passed down. 

Years of corporate acquisitions, billion-dollar deals, and strategic battles in boardrooms had honed her into a formidable leader. The triumphs were satisfying, but true peace had remained elusive. The ambition that fueled her left no space for contentment. The calm moments with her grandfather and in her meditation practice were elusive now. 

Her initial meditation practice had been a simple tool for stress management, fifteen minutes squeezed in after her morning workout, before the first meeting of the day. But recently, those moments had taken on a different tone. The same sharp mind that parsed corporate balance sheets now turned inward, dissecting the very foundation she’d built her life upon. She wondered how long she could keep walking both paths. It was becoming more apparent she would have to either choose the path of enlightenment or the path of worldly pleasures. 

“Proper temple offerings can generate great merit,” her grandfather’s voice echoed in her mind. “But true merit comes from helping others find the path.” 

She had always assumed he spoke of his donations to the Pure Land temples. Those gestures she’d admired but never deeply questioned. Now, as she watched the moon’s reflection fracture on the water’s surface, she wondered if his words had held another meaning, one she may have been blind to. 

Georgia returned the beads to her pocket, their weight grounding her as she stood. The tailored lines of her designer suit seemed almost absurd against the simplicity of the scene. In the corporate world, she was known as a force, brilliant, uncompromising, always in control. Yet none of them knew of the doubts that gnawed at her, the growing suspicion that her achievements were just another layer of suffering. The question that had begun to haunt her surfaced again: what if all her power and resources could be repurposed for something beyond wealth? 

Her gaze drifted back to the main house, where Ed and the others stood on the porch, their laughter reaching her faintly in the breeze. That familiar tangle of envy and yearning twisted in her chest. They had found the answer her grandfather had hinted at, the one she had been skirting all her life. The question remained—was she ready to search for it herself? 

“I heard you made your money the old-fashioned way, Georgia,” Tim said, his grin warm as she stepped onto the porch. 

Georgia took in the scene, a familiar space filled with trusted faces, and met his eyes, her own smile controlled. The breeze tugged gently at her long, straight black hair, which she wore down her back. Her button nose crinkled slightly as she responded, and her hazel eyes, sharp with experience, met his. 

“Yes, yes, I inherited it,” she replied, her tone light but layered. “But my real work has been in managing it, and at that, I have excelled.” Her gaze drifted over the others, seven in total, seated comfortably as they looked out at the lush field that rolled into the forest’s edge. This land had belonged to her grandfather, who had spent his final years tending to it, a simple life reminiscent of his youth in Japan. 

He had named it Jeta’s Grove, explaining to her more than once the story of the businessman who had gifted land and a monastery to the Buddha and his followers. The name had always resonated with her. Unlike her grandfather, who had devotedly funded Pure Land temples across San Francisco and beyond, her father had shed much of that religious commitment when they left California during her childhood. 

Georgia leaned back, watching the others as they relaxed on the porch. 

Funding the protocol had been a calculated risk, one she took without expecting results. Yet the changes she saw in those who had undergone it, especially Ed, who she’d known for years, had shaken her. The man who now sat before them seemed both familiar and profoundly transformed. 

“We have a while before lunch will be ready,” she said, pushing aside the tangle of thoughts and settling into one of the rocking chairs. She glanced at Ed, her tone light but inviting. “Would you share some thoughts in the meantime?” 

Ed’s smile was subtle as he nodded, shifting his chair slightly to better face the group. He didn’t stand; there was no need. His presence commanded attention effortlessly. Georgia noted the small audience, Tim, Sarah and a few others from the retreat center, plus two workers who had joined them for a brief respite before the meal. The morning sunlight bathed them all in a warm glow, casting soft shadows that danced across the porch. 

“Of course, Georgia, of course,” Ed began, his gaze moving gently across each face. To Georgia, he was the same man she’d always known, yet utterly changed. The furrows that once marked his face with worry had smoothed, and the restless energy she remembered was gone. Instead, he radiated a calm so deep, it was almost tangible. Georgia felt an ache in her chest, she wanted that peace, needed it in a way she could scarcely admit. 

“I am humbled by Georgia’s offer of residence here at her Jeta’s Grove and grateful to be in the position in my life to accept,” Ed said, his voice resonant and sure. The air seemed to still as he continued. “Many ask me what it is like to be enlightened, and the truth is they…” he paused, his gaze sweeping down the row of listeners, “you… already know.” 

Georgia’s breath caught for a moment. Her grandfather’s teachings surfaced in her mind, the Zen proverbs she’d once listened to with the impatience of youth. Ed’s words sounded like an echo of those lessons, but now they resonated differently. 

“It really is the breeze on the skin. The earth under our feet,” Ed said, punctuating his point with a couple of light kicks to the porch boards. “It means being fully aware of everything around you without judging it as good or bad. Before, I was a prisoner of my own reactions. Each reaction was based on previous reactions, creating a chain going back so far that I had no hope of breaking free from it. Yet, with a little help,” he added, a playful smile breaking through as he winked, “I was able to break each link in that chain. I could finally see and understand the root causes behind all my unhealthy patterns of thinking and behavior.” 

Georgia’s pulse quickened. The simplicity of his words hinted at a deeper transformation. She stilled, wondering what that peace would feel like. 

“It was as if I was stuck in the waking moment,” Ed continued, his voice weaving through the stillness, “where one cannot quite discern what is real and what is a remnant of the dream. In shaking the head and rubbing the face, the dream flees, and the light from the bedroom window strikes the eyes and warms the skin, convincing one that yes, now they are fully awake. That is how it is now.” 

The metaphor stirred something within Georgia, a yearning for clarity she had never acknowledged. He spoke with calm certainty that resonated deep in her chest, pulling at the questions she kept buried beneath boardroom strategies and asset portfolios. 

“After my retirement, with that emptiness of the hours, the emptiness of my house after the loss of my dear wife, I yearned to awaken from that sterile suffering,” Ed said, his gaze meeting hers for a moment. Georgia recognized the longing in his eyes. “Yet I did not know how. I meditated, I bowed, I prayed to the great Amitabha Buddha to deliver me to the Pure Land. I moved to this hermitage. There was utility in this, of course. It helped with my blood pressure. It reminded me to do better, to be kinder, to keep striving. Yet the fuel which kept the fire of my passions fed remained.” 

Georgia leaned forward slightly, the porch creaking beneath her as she listened. The restlessness, the striving without ever reaching satisfaction, mirrored the engine that had driven her for so long. She thought of the merger she’d orchestrated last quarter—how the thrill of closing the $4 billion deal had lasted barely a week before her mind was already hunting for the next acquisition. Or the beachfront property in Malibu she’d purchased after three years of negotiations, only to visit twice before the emptiness crept back in. No matter how many companies she added to her portfolio or how many zeros appeared in her net worth, that gnawing sense of “not enough” always returned, pushing her toward the next challenge, the next conquest. 

“What kept that fire burning?” Ed’s voice softened. “The fuel was my endless wanting of pleasant experiences, my pushing away of unpleasant ones, and all my judgments about both. As I learned to step back from these reactions, one by one, I could simply be aware without constantly evaluating everything. A deep sense of balance emerged, allowing me to be fully present without being pulled toward pleasure or pushed away from pain. When I stopped adding fuel, the distracting fire naturally went out. That’s when I could truly see the world as it is - how everything connects and flows into everything else without separation. And then I realized my own awareness works the same way. Through directly experiencing this, not just thinking about it, I could see that nothing has a fixed, permanent nature - including myself. The fuel that I thought was necessary was never really there. I’m exactly where I always was, just fully awake to it now.” 

Georgia’s mind buzzed with unasked questions as the lunch bell rang, cutting through the spell Ed’s words had cast. The group exchanged bows, murmuring thanks as they rose. Georgia offered Ed a quiet, sincere nod before turning to lead everyone inside. 

One of the attendees quickened his pace to catch up with her and chuckled lightly. “Do you think this protocol would alleviate the silent suffering of my mandatory staff meeting tomorrow morning?” 

It was a jest, casual and harmless, but it struck a nerve in Georgia. She forced a smile, though her thoughts raced. The young man reminded her of her assistant, the one who had helped install her AI hub and the virtual reality boardroom in her home office. Would her own board meetings feel trivial if she went through the protocol? Would she even care to hold board meetings at all? 

The thought expanded, unwelcome and heavy. If she no longer needed to chase success, would her assistant, her secretary or anyone else still have jobs if she suddenly stopped needing anything? The implications coiled inside her, making her fingers tighten around the porch railing until her knuckles whitened. She stood abruptly, her heart racing as scenarios flashed through her mind like warning signals. Just because she stopped needing things didn’t mean others wouldn’t still need to feed their families. 

She glanced back at Ed, catching his calm profile as he entered the house the screen door closing with a soft click behind him. This time, she saw him not just as an old friend transformed but as a challenge, a vision of what lay ahead if she dared to follow. Georgia released her grip on the railing and brushed her palms against her tailored slacks, trying to wipe away both the splinters and the sudden doubt.
