“Once manufactured, each headset would have the artificial intelligence protocol preloaded onto it before delivery,” Tim said the next day. After six months of successful trials, they were ready for the next step. “The software will be reusable for the life of the hardware, encrypted, including both hard and soft fail-safes to prevent unauthorized modifications or copying.” 

Georgia drew in a long breath. “Is this a functional prototype?” she asked, pointing at the sleek headset on her desk. 

“Not currently. The hardware is operational, but the artificial intelligence software hasn’t been loaded yet.” Tim’s gaze drifted to the device, a hint of anticipation in his eyes. Georgia knew he fully grasped the magnitude of what they had created. To them, it was nothing less than an algorithm to enlightenment, a path so direct that it banished doubt, leaving only discovery in its wake. 

She stood and turned to face the darkened window, the heavy rain drumming against the glass with relentless intensity. The revelation left her reeling. She hadn’t realized the protocol was so close to mass production. But she reminded herself, why would she? The retreat center had kept her at arm’s length, a deliberate exclusion reinforced by the teachers who had joined Tim to guide others after their own experiences with the protocol. A sudden realization sparked her mind. 

“Carly doesn’t know you’re here, does she?” Georgia asked, keeping her eyes on the rain-slicked cityscape. 

Tim joined her by the window, his silence stretching between them like the dark clouds outside. 

“They don’t know you have this prototype, or the protocol either, do they?” she pressed, a note of suspicion sharpening her voice. 

Tim’s response came measured and indirect. “Few at the center have been more vocal about caution than I have.” 

“What changed?” she turned to face him, searching his expression. 

“Jeta’s Grove, what is happening there with the teaching, and those who have gone through the protocol,” he said, his voice softening, eyes glistening with an unspoken emotion. “It showed me that there’s a place in this world for enlightenment. Whether they want to accept it or not, the wheel of dharma is turning, right now.” 

“Spinning it too hard might throw it off its axis,” she replied, an eyebrow arching. 

“There are enough obstacles in this world, fear, attachment, decadence, comfort, ignorance,” he said, trailing off before refocusing on the prototype. “But lack of access for those seeking liberation shouldn’t be one of them. People have wandered further from the truth of their suffering and the hope of release for too long.” 

Georgia sighed and stepped back to her chair, sitting down heavily as if the weight of the decision had already settled on her shoulders. Tim perched on the corner of her desk and picked up the headset, turning it over in his hands. The rain’s tempo seemed to quicken. 

“The real innovation isn’t just the hardware,” Tim began, tracing the headset’s sleek curve. “It’s how we solved the quantum decoherence problem.” 

Georgia’s brow lifted slightly. “Explain.” 

“Most neural tech forces the brain into set states, but this protocol acts as a mirror. It shows you your mind’s own illusions, leaving you to unravel them.” 

“And the encryption?” Georgia’s mind shifted to the security implications. 

“Multi-layered. The quantum encryption key is partially generated by the user’s own neural patterns. Each unit unhackable. Sarah, one of our coders, embedded the AI’s core algorithms into quantum dots within the processor. They are impossible to copy or modify without destroying them.” 

Georgia absorbed the intricacies of the design. This was no ordinary device. This was an intersection of technology and human consciousness. It redefined how minds could perceive themselves. 

“And you fit all that into something this compact?” She picked up prototype number five   , feeling the surprising lightness of its frame. 

Tim’s face split into a smile. “That was the true engineering hurdle. Stabilizing quantum components at room temperature took us years. But it had to be practical and usable. Otherwise, what’s the point?” 

Georgia’s mind shifted into strategy mode. From a logistical standpoint, she could scale this into mass production despite the complexities involved. Finding the right location, sourcing rare materials, hiring a trusted team, it was all possible. Keeping the operation discreet, however, would be a challenge of its own. 

The real question, though, wasn’t whether she could do it, but whether she should. She reached out for the headset, noting the number five etched into its side. 

“Five prototypes already?” she asked, unable to mask her surprise. 

“Yes,” Tim said, taking the headset back. “This is the latest. In the six months since our first successful test, twelve people have reached enlightenment using the first four. This one is up next for testing. They’re all identical, and they all work. We’re ready for mass production.” 

“If,” she emphasized, “and I do mean if, we move forward, we can’t do it here.” 

Tim’s expression brightened with a touch of hope. “There’s always the old bunker.” 

“It’s not equipped for this kind of work, and it’s been sealed for so long that finding the entrance might be impossible. We need a proper warehouse. If we do this, it’ll require space, power and a team to make it happen.”
