Frank O’Hearn leaned forward as Sarah Martinez took the witness chair. He had spent weeks finding the right victims to testify, people whose stories would strike the right chord with the committee members’ constituents. He couldn’t afford to let this moment slip by without impact. 

“My husband, Michael, underwent the protocol in December,” Martinez began, dabbing at her eyes. The slight tremor in her voice was perfect. “He’d always been interested in meditation, but this was different. Within days, he’d withdraw all our savings, quit his job, and moved to some kind of commune. Left me alone with our three-year-old daughter…” 

Frank’s gaze swept across the room, assessing the reactions. Committee members scribbled notes, their faces a mixture of concern and calculation. Representative Green, who had dismissed the hearings as alarmist earlier, now wore a furrowed brow. That shift meant something; Frank logged it as a potential advantage. 

“Did he give any explanation?” Chairman Roberts asked gently, leaning in as though to catch every word. 

“He said he’d ‘seen through the illusion’ of our life together,” Martinez replied, her voice cracking at just the right moment. “Said raising our daughter in ‘ignorance’ would be cruel. What kind of father abandons his child for enlightenment?” 

Frank felt a grim satisfaction settle in his chest. He had coached her to emphasize the family abandonment angle, ensuring it stung in all the right places. Next, James Wilson would testify, another carefully chosen witness. 

“Lost my best chef after fifteen years,” Wilson began, his tone clipped with frustration. “No notice, no explanation. Just said he didn’t need money anymore and walked out mid-shift. Had to close three nights that week. Business still hasn’t recovered…” 

Frank’s eyes darted to Chairman Roberts, whose expression tightened.  

“And this former employee, have you had any contact with him since?” Roberts asked. 

“Found him serving free meals at a homeless shelter,” Wilson scoffed. “Master chef with fifteen years’ experience, feeding soup to junkies. What a waste.” 

Frank noted the subtle nods from several committee members. The narrative was taking root as he had envisioned: the protocol as a menace unraveling families, businesses, and social cohesion. Yet, the reality grated on him. Too many of those touched by the protocol were annoyingly difficult to frame as victims. They spoke of joy, fulfillment, and peace—sentiments that threatened to undercut everything he was building.
