“They’re already here,” Carly replied when she got Zach’s frantic call. “They’re almost finished. They seized everything, gave me a cease-and-desist order.” 

“I’m on my way,” Zach replied, “Anyone hurt?” 

“No, no, no,” Carly assured him, “They’ve been very professional, and we’ve been very compliant.” 

“Did they show you a warrant?” he asked. 

“Yes, I called our attorney, and he was able to speak to one of the agents and everything appears to be ok for now,” Carly answered, noticing some commotion in the next room. “Listen, let’s talk when you get here, I’ve got to go.” 

“Ok, I should be there in about an hour.” 

An entire team of agents had shown up at the retreat center at Jeta’s Grove that morning and immediately started asking questions and gathering everything that appeared to them to be related to the protocol. Luckily, most of the meditators were in the large meditation hall when they came in, so the initial shock of the visit was limited to Carly and a few of the front office workers. It still seemed like a nightmare as she shook her head, put the phone back into her pocket, and went to find out what the ruckus was about. 

“They’ve asked Ed to come with them and he’s agreed,” someone exclaimed as she entered the next room and saw a few of the residents standing around Ed, looking as if they were trying to protect him from the agents. 

“He shouldn’t go,” another person shouted, “they have no right to take him!” 

Carly was torn. She couldn’t stop him, and it may look bad if she tried. On the other hand, Ed knew almost everything about the retreat center, and surely, he’d be more than happy to be honest with anyone who questioned him.  

“Please,” Carly interjected, moving into the middle of the crowd, “Ed is more than capable of making his own decisions and looking after himself.” 

The group that had gathered looked surprised and upset Carly seemed to be taking the wrong side. “Do you mind if I tag along, Ed?” she asked, then looked toward the agent who was trying to lead him out, “Would that be alright, Agent Gile?” 

Agent Gile had been one of the more reasonable and approachable ones during what Carly couldn’t help but think of as a raid. She also seemed to be a senior agent, so Carly hoped she was the right one to ask. 

“Sure, that would be fine,” Agent Gile replied as she turned to lead them out of the center. She reached for a small device that looked like an old walkie talkie and said, “Two to transport.”
