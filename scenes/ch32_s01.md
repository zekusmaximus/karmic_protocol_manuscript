Zach set the video game controller on the table and leaned back into the worn embrace of his couch. He had been determined to beat this level without adjusting the difficulty setting, but tonight wasn’t going to be the night. 

He considered switching on the news but quickly dismissed the idea. The thought of the karmic protocol’s grand rollout resurfaced, and with it, the gnawing ache of wondering just how disastrous it had been. How many people had used the devices? He had no way of knowing. 

Zach shifted on the couch, reminding himself of the plan: stay under the radar, refuse all interview requests, and, most importantly, maintain complete silence on his phone, email, social media, anything that could be traced. The isolation left a bitter taste of loneliness and a creeping sense of helplessness he couldn’t shake, but he reminded himself it was necessary. 

Someone would contact him when it was time for the next phase. Until then, he needed to remain invisible, avoid drawing any attention. The days blurred together floating between video games, and increasingly futile attempts at meditation. His mind refused to settle, thoughts slamming into one another with an urgency he couldn’t suppress. He sipped from a glass of water, then lay flat on the couch, rubbing his tired eyes. 

It struck him how long it had been since he’d last taken a call, replied to an email, or sent a text. Not since… ever, really. The disconnect gnawed at him; he was desperate to know how the others were holding up. And yet, there was an odd relief in the silence. Without the constant barrage of notifications, he noticed the neglected pile of dishes, the laundry spilling out of the basket, the unopened bills. Frustrating, yes, but it brought an unexpected sense of clarity. 

He exhaled slowly. The likelihood of finding work in tech again was laughably slim, he knew that. Maybe he’d end up behind the counter at a local comic book or video game store. 

Zach’s mind drifted to the moment of his rapid initiation into the dharmapalas, their solemn vow echoing in his ears. “I vow to delay personal enlightenment until those who have not attained it, attain it,” he silently repeated. The words, spoken in the privacy of his thoughts, carried the weight of the commitment he had made. 

In practice, this meant agreeing not to use the protocol until it could be safeguarded as an option for those prepared for enlightenment. He knew well that, much like the metaphorical vehicles of traditional Buddhist teachings, the protocol was discarded once it had fulfilled its purpose. Not all users who reached enlightenment felt compelled to teach meditation, and none had chosen to replicate or distribute the headsets. The dharmapalas, he realized with a tightening in his chest, would be essential for the foreseeable future. 

Unless, of course, production resumed. The idea loomed in his mind, a labyrinth of potential risks, obstacles and delicate negotiations. Still, they had managed to awaken people once before. It wasn’t impossible. Improbable, definitely, but he could work with improbable. 

Zach’s gaze unfocused as memories of those final days before the shipments surfaced. The dharmapalas had been offered one last chance to revoke their vow and use the protocol themselves, a fair gesture considering their mission and the difficulties that lay ahead. Yet not a single member had taken it. Zach hadn’t even hesitated in his refusal back then. 

Now, though, the thought lingered. Doubt crept through him, subtle and insidious, and he allowed himself to feel it. After all, he had nothing but time. Even if hundreds or thousands found awakening through their work, could society truly adapt to the reality of a karmic protocol? The question gnawed at him. Was he destined to spend his life playing a relentless game of whack-a-mole with governments and institutions, forever on the run as the elusive target? 

He also considered the possibility of losing. What if every headset was seized and destroyed? The thought left him with a hollow feeling in his chest. Where would that leave him? Unenlightened, for one. Perpetually monitored, or worse, marked as one of the few who had helped code the protocol but never used it. 

Zach swung his legs off the couch and sat up, flicking on the television. The news, he figured, couldn’t be worse than spiraling deeper into his own well of fear, uncertainty, and creeping self-pity. 

The screen lit up with a report about upcoming congressional inquiry hearings on the protocol. A dry laugh escaped him at the thought of an “invitation” landing in his inbox. From what he could piece together, the hearings would be heavily skewed, more spectacle than substance. He doubted anyone from their side would have a seat at the table. The administration wasn’t about to risk putting him, Carly Rice, or God forbid, Georgia Sato in front of the cameras. The last thing they wanted was to give any of them more airtime. 

His mind shifted to the awakened. Would any of them be asked to testify? Unlikely, he decided. In his experience, the kind of people invited to testify were already aligned with the desired narrative. This wasn’t about fact-finding; it was theater, a performance engineered to defend and rationalize the questionable actions that had been taken, and the ones that were surely yet to come. 

The broadcast switched to a live segment from Geneva, catching Zach’s attention. An official from the World Health Organization was mid-sentence. “…the inability of our scientists to rigorously evaluate the device has made it impossible to determine whether it is in violation. We look forward to testifying before the United States Congress and are taking a hard look at amendments to our Global Model Regulatory Framework for Medical Devices, which we concede are now dated and inadequate to deal with the speed at which technology is evolving.” 

Zach’s jaw clenched. The implications of those words were clear, regulatory amendments, bureaucratic delays, a race against the clock he wasn’t sure they could win.
