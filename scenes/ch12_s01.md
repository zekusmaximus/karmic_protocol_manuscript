Bud found Frank O’Hearn waiting in his office when he returned from lunch. The sight made his pulse quicken; Frank’s presence was rarely a precursor to good news. The Chairman stood at the window, hands clasped behind his back, staring out at the city skyline with an expression Bud couldn’t quite read from behind. 

“Quite a view,” Frank said, not bothering to turn. His voice dropped half an octave, each word coming slower than the last. Bud watched his shoulders tense, saw his fingers tightening into fists as the silence between sentences stretched uncomfortably long. 

“If only that were true,” Bud finally muttered as he lowered himself into his chair, the leather creaking under him. He forced a calm he didn’t feel, knowing this conversation had been inevitable ever since Tim Mulvaney’s presentation. “I take it you’ve read the transcript?” he asked, keeping his tone even. 

Frank turned, the light from outside casting deep lines across his usually stoic face. Bud’s stomach tightened as he caught the rare flicker of concern in the man’s eyes. “Multiple times. This isn’t just another wellness app or meditation guide. From what I can read between the lines of that transcript, they’re talking about fundamentally rewiring human consciousness.” 

Bud swallowed, the taste of black coffee and apprehension bitter on his tongue. “And they’ve apparently succeeded,” he said, leaning forward. He thought back to lunch, how Zach’s eyes had darted nervously whenever that Senate staffer pressed him about the protocol? “Did you see how Zach couldn’t quite meet anyone’s eyes during lunch?” 

“Like Everett,” Frank said, his expression hardening as he moved to sit across from Bud. The way Frank’s mouth pressed into a thin line told Bud he’d been thinking about her too. “Sharp one, that girl. Too sharp.” He let the rest trail off, the silence doing more to rattle Bud than words could. 

“She’s works for the senate, I’d hope she is,” Bud agreed, the thought coiling tighter in his chest. But there was something else gnawing at him, something he saw reflected in the shadow that crossed Frank’s face. “But that’s not what’s really keeping you up at night, is it?” 

Frank leaned forward, elbows digging into his knees, the fabric of his suit straining as if burdened by the weight of what he was about to said. “What concerns me, Bud, is what happens when this thing hits wide circulation.” His voice dropped, but the intensity in his gaze did not. “You saw the numbers in Mulvaney’s report, they’re claiming a hundred percent success rate. A hundred percent. Do you have any idea what that could do to the pillars holding up society?” 

Bud’s chest tightened. He’d spent nights haunted by that very thought, imagining the unraveling of economies, the collapse of purpose in millions of lives. He nodded slowly, the motion deliberate. “I’ve given it some thought,” he said, choosing his words with care. The understatement tasted like a lie. “The economic implications alone…” 

“Exactly.” Frank’s fist thudded against the armrest, the sound sharp, final. Bud felt the reverberation in his core. “A mass exodus from the workforce. Who’s going to give a damn about quarterly profits or market share when they’ve achieved…” Frank’s voice faltered, and he waved a hand as if dismissing a notion too absurd to name, “…whatever enlightenment this thing offers?” 

Bud nodded slowly, the weight of the implications pressing down on him like a physical burden. “And that’s assuming the best-case scenario, that it actually does what they claim. If it doesn’t…” 

“Then we’re looking at a public health crisis unlike anything we’ve seen before, rewiring people’s brains, this goes beyond wireless signals causing brain cancer.” Frank finished, his voice sharp as a blade. The urgency in the room crackled between them. “Either way, this needs to be contained. Now.” 

Bud took a steadying breath, choosing his words with care. “The industry can’t handle this alone. We’d need coordination across multiple agencies, FDA, FCC, Homeland Security…” 

Frank’s eyes sparked with recognition. Bud could see the gears turning behind that calculating gaze. “You still have that contact at the Office of Science and Technology Policy?” 

“Constance Henning,” Bud confirmed. The mention of her name stirred a memory of late-night phone calls dissecting policies that teetered on the edge of technological overreach. “She’d understand the implications.” He hesitated, ensuring he had Frank’s full attention. The room seemed to tighten around them. “But Frank… once we bring in the government, we lose control of the narrative. This becomes bigger than any of us.” 

Frank’s expression didn’t waver. If anything, the edges of his mouth twitched into a hard line. “Sometimes that’s exactly what you need,” he said, pushing himself up from the chair. “Set up a meeting. Quietly. We need to get ahead of this before Mulvaney and his friends start handing these headsets out on the street corners.” 

Bud’s heart thudded in his chest, but he forced himself to keep his voice steady. “And Goodman? He’s still technically one of ours.” 

Frank’s face hardened, the air between them growing colder. “Not for long. I think it’s time we did some house cleaning of our own.” He strode toward the door but paused, hand on the knob. “Good work at the conference, by the way. Getting Mulvaney to speak may have been the best intelligence we could have hoped for.”
