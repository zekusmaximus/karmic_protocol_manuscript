Tim and Georgia walked the perimeter of the empty warehouse, their heels clicking against the concrete. The vast space seemed to hold its breath, waiting, as if it sensed the significance of what was about to happen. They had chosen this location carefully. It was remote enough for privacy but equipped with the robust power infrastructure needed for the AI components. 

The loading dock caught his eye; it would serve their purposes well. But he knew it was the pond out back that had sealed the deal for Georgia. She stood at the dock doors now, her gaze fixed on the late afternoon light playing across the water’s surface. 

Tim noted her expression change as she mentioned her grandfather’s fishing pond and the lessons she’d learned there about patience and strategy. “Watch long enough,” he remembered her quoting, “and you’ll see where the fish are going, not just where they are.” The principle had guided their entire search for this place. 

Tim’s mind shifted from memories to logistics. He and Georgia had analyzed power grid patterns, local development plans and traffic flows. They had ensured this property stayed off competitors’ radars through a web of shell companies and subtle inquiries. Georgia’s voice echoed in his mind: in corporate acquisitions, the art was making your target look worthless. 

He reached into his pocket and wrapped his fingers around his brother’s prayer beads, feeling their familiar weight. To Tim, this warehouse wasn’t just a facility; it was a sanctuary. It would need to safeguard far more than intellectual property. 

They walked to the entrance, Tim’s thoughts already mapping out security protocols. Georgia had paid a premium for the place, maneuvering through a maze of indirect transactions—the kind of financial choreography she excelled at. Her grandfather’s lesson on hidden value lingered in Tim’s mind as he glanced at her, knowing she had applied it here too.
