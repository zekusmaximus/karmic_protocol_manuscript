Outside, one of the newly enlightened from the center found himself seated on a low bench near the courtyard fountain. The cool water spilled in steady arcs, the rhythm as precise as breath, as natural as the rise and fall of the sun. He didn’t need to watch it to feel its flow. The pulse of the fountain and the distant hum of insects in the evening air moved through him, as seamless as the blood in his veins. 

A memory surfaced, unbidden but welcome. Before the protocol, he had been an architect, his days consumed by blueprints and deadlines, his nights restless with the fear of failure. He had lived for symmetry, control, the satisfaction of things fitting neatly into their places. Awakening had revealed what he couldn’t see then: there was no neatness in the world, no perfect edges or straight lines. The beauty lay in its imperfections, in the way each piece held its place in the whole, whether he understood it or not. 

The fountain’s rhythm shifted slightly, the wind catching the water mid-arc and scattering it into fine droplets. He smiled faintly, feeling the cool mist on his face. The government’s plans being formed tonight were as fleeting as those droplets. And yet, they mattered. Not because they would succeed or fail, but because they were the next step, the next note in a melody that had no end. 

A shadow moved across the courtyard as someone passed by, their silhouette cast briefly against the stone wall. He felt their energy. He didn’t need to know who it was to understand them. Their drive was familiar, human. 

He rose slowly, his movements unhurried, and turned toward the retreat’s garden path. The stones beneath his feet were cool, each one worn smooth by countless steps over countless days. He didn’t need to see the path ahead to trust it. The striving was simply the world, reaching toward itself. 

The night deepened around him, the stars emerging one by one in the vast sky above. He paused for a moment, gazing upward. The stars didn’t compete for space or brilliance. They simply were, each one adding its light to the whole. As he continued down the path, the faint sounds of conversation drifted on the breeze, mingling with the rustle of leaves and the murmur of the fountain. 

Awakening wasn’t about answers. It was about knowing there were none to seek. And yet, every step was worth taking, every voice worth hearing, every ripple worth feeling. He moved on, the harmony of the moment carrying him forward, whole and at peace.
