Frank O’Hearn read the Goodman decision for the third time, each word tightening his jaw further. The lines taunted him, cold and sharp: fabricate evidence of wrongdoing injurious to the reputation and future employability of the claimant. 

He slammed the document onto his desk, the sound echoing through the quiet office, and strode to the window to gather his thoughts. He could already envision the Board’s restless eyes searching for a scapegoat. Despite his best efforts to stall the inevitable, an emergency meeting loomed on the horizon, and his meticulously crafted case against the protocol was unraveling faster than he could mend the breaches. 

The intercom buzzed, breaking the silence. “Mr. Whitman is here to see you, sir.” 

Frank’s gaze stayed on the city skyline. “Send him in.” 

The door opened, and Guy Whitman stepped in without a sound. Even in retirement, the man exuded the disciplined presence of a soldier. Frank had appointed him as head of his personal security just weeks earlier, a decision he now felt vindicated in as the Board’s anger mounted. 

“I believe I’m going to be relieved of my chairmanship this evening,” Frank said, not bothering with formalities. “Possibly removed from the Board entirely.” 

Whitman stood motionless, a slight twitch at the corner of his mouth betraying his reaction. “I’d heard as much. Their loss. Is there even a workforce left to chair over?” 

Frank turned, meeting Whitman’s steady gaze. “Who knows? It will, at least, allow me to focus on other matters. The protocol issue won’t solve itself. This isn’t going away, this is going to continue to eat at society.” 

Whitman’s eyes narrowed. “That son of a bitch Goodman up to something?” 

Frank shook his head slightly. “Goodman, Mulvaney, Sato, take your pick. Too much silence from all three.” 

“Mulvaney’s been quiet for a reason,” Whitman said, a dark chuckle underlining his words. 

Frank’s lips pressed into a thin line. “And the FBI let him go yesterday.” He saw Whitman’s eyebrows lift, the soldier’s composed demeanor giving way to a flicker of surprise. “Makes you wonder who’s really pulling strings at the Bureau.” 

“Think the administration’s trying to cover themselves now that they’re shoving this under the rug?” Whitman asked, eyes sharpening. 

“Likely.” Frank moved behind his desk, his fingers brushing over a stack of papers before pulling out a thick file. “And we both know what festers under rugs when garbage is swept there.” He handed Whitman the file, a dossier thick with surveillance updates. “Trout and Cray’s latest. Details on Goodman’s behavior, Mulvaney’s movements, and the ongoing search for Sato. Goodman’s been holed up at home, playing video games, of all things, while waiting for his civil case to resolve. Now that it’s gone in his favor, he’ll make a move. I can feel it.” 

Whitman nodded, eyes scanning the cover of the file as if weighing its contents. “Where do you want me to start?” 

“Goodman. You know where he lives.” Frank’s voice was clipped, a directive. “But the priority is finding proof that production is starting up again.” 

Whitman’s gaze met his. “The Sato property?” 

“Jeta’s Grove. Something never sat right about those searches,” Frank muttered, drumming his fingers on the desk. The place was vast, acres of dense woodland. He doubted anyone had scoured it thoroughly. “Without federal backing, we’ll need to be creative about getting access. But it’s worth pursuing.” 

“It will be my pleasure,” Whitman said, a resolute glint in his eyes as he turned for the door. Frank noted the tension in the man’s jaw, a flicker of remembered enmity there. Whitman had never spoken of it, but Frank had sensed it, the way Foreman’s serene smile haunted him, embodying everything they both needed to dismantle. “We need to stop this before it spreads any further.” 

Whitman’s lips twitched into a smirk. “About damn time.” The door closed softly behind him, leaving the room in a heavy silence.
