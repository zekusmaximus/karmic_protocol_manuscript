A sound interrupted his thoughts, a keycard unlocking the cell door. 

Tim opened his eyes as a nondescript, well-dressed man stepped in. The door remained ajar, an unexpected detail that sharpened Tim’s attention. 

“Mr. Mulvaney,” the man said, taking a step further into the cell while glancing around. “I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience your detainment has caused.” 

Tim blinked, uncertain if he had heard correctly. “Apologize?” 

“Yes,” the man said, stepping aside so the cell door remained unblocked. “Our counterparts at Homeland Security are a bit rough around the edges.” 

Tim’s confusion deepened. “Your counterparts?” The words felt hollow as they left his mouth. 

The man shrugged. “As soon as you were transferred into the custody of the Bureau, we started working on getting you out of here.” 

“The Bureau?” Tim repeated, the disbelief apparent in his voice. 

The man continued as if on autopilot. “I’m afraid I don’t have many answers, probably none. The good news is, you’re free to go.” He gestured toward the open door. 

“Go where?” Tim asked, the question escaping before he could temper his reaction. The sudden shift felt surreal, like stepping from a dream into a trap. 

“Anywhere you like,” the man said calmly. “Your interview is over, and the Bureau has no basis, or interest, in holding you any longer.” 

Tim’s mind raced. Classic ‘release and catch’ tactic, he thought. They would release him, shadow his movements, watch who he contacted. It would mean constant vigilance, but it was still preferable to confinement. He moved hesitantly to the threshold, only realizing he was unsure of which direction to take as he paused. Glancing back, he saw the agent pointing to the left. 

He followed the corridor, each step feeling deliberate and weighted. Where am I being released from? He had no idea if he was still in the same city or had been moved states away. The brightness ahead caught his attention, and he squinted as sunlight filtered through the windows near what appeared to be an exit. 

“Your belongings are bagged up on the counter there,” came the voice from behind him. “Can’t vouch that everything’s there, but that’s what they sent along.” 

Tim picked up the black bag, the weight oddly familiar. Is this the same bag they put over my head when they took me? The man’s words echoed in his mind. The interview is over. No basis or interest in keeping me. He slung the bag over his shoulder without checking its contents. Everything in here will need to be destroyed, he thought, including the clothes on his back. Can’t risk any hidden bugs, electronic or otherwise. 

The Bureau agent brushed past him and pushed open the door, revealing what looked like an ordinary office building lobby. “You’re not far from where they said they picked you up, closer to downtown than the pier,” the man said, reaching into his breast pocket and pulling out an envelope. 

Tim’s eyes narrowed. “What’s this?” he asked, taking the envelope. 

“Cab fare,” the agent replied before stepping out onto the sidewalk. Tim peered inside; the envelope held more cash than a simple cab ride would cost, along with a small slip of paper. Suspicion prickled at him. This keeps getting stranger. 

“So, no warnings or conditions?” Tim asked, scanning the street as he oriented himself. 

“Nope,” the agent said flatly. Without another word, he turned back, disappeared into the building, and locked the door behind him.
