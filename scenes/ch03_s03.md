Later that evening, after Finn and John had left, Tim sat in a plastic chair on the fire escape, the metal cool against his legs. The city hummed softly beneath them, and Jessica leaned over the railing, exhaling a deep sigh into the crisp night air. Tim glanced up at the moon, luminous and watchful, though the streetlights washed out the stars. 

“I don’t know that I’m ready for enlightenment,” Jessica said suddenly, turning to meet Tim’s eyes. The streetlamp cast sharp shadows across her face, making her expression seem more vulnerable. “But I’m surprised you haven’t already gone through the protocol.” 

Tim shifted, the chair creaking beneath him. “I’m not ready either,” he admitted, the words heavy on his tongue. “Probably for different reasons, though.” 

A smirk broke across Jessica’s face. “I still fancy myself a woman with much trouble to get up to.” 

Tim let out a short laugh, warmth breaking through the seriousness. “One of the many things I like about you, Jessica.” He stood, stretching his arms and nodding toward the window. “Come on. I want to show you something.” 

They stepped back into the dimly lit apartment, the air warmer and carrying the scent of the books that lined the shelves. Tim picked up a worn book from the coffee table, its spine cracked from years of use and opened to a page. The image seemed to pulse with vibrant colors, a six-armed figure surrounded by flames, dark blue skin, fierce eyes, crowned with skulls, and standing over a crushed figure. Weapons gleamed from each hand, and a necklace of severed heads draped across its chest. 

Jessica leaned in, eyes wide. “It’s hideous,” she said, a grin breaking through. “I love it.” 

“A dharmapala,” Tim said, running a finger along the edge of the page. “A guardian of the dharma. Fierce, terrifying, but ultimately a protector of the path to enlightenment.” He closed the book gently, looking up at Jessica. “These wrathful deities aren’t evil—they represent the forceful compassion needed to protect wisdom from being corrupted. That’s why I’m not ready for the protocol yet. Do you remember what a bodhisattva is?” 

Jessica’s brow furrowed, processing what Tim had just explained about the AI-powered VR system. “A being who forsakes their own enlightenment until everyone else has attained it.” 

“Exactly.” Tim nodded, the light catching the silver at his temples. “In Buddhist tradition, a bodhisattva reaches the threshold of complete liberation—what we call Buddhahood—but makes a sacred vow to remain in the cycle of suffering until all sentient beings are free. They could cross over into perfect awakening, but choose to stay behind as guides instead.” 

“The path…” Jessica said with newfound understanding. “You’re talking about the protocol, aren’t you? You think it needs protection?” 

“It will,” Tim said, tapping the closed cover of the book, the weight of conviction pressing into his chest. “What we’ve created isn’t just technology—it’s a shortcut through millennia of spiritual practice. The protocol can burn through lifetimes of accumulated karma in hours, leaving a person fully awakened. But that kind of power—instant Buddhahood without the gradual tempering of the spiritual path—it could be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Or even in well-meaning but unprepared minds.” 

Jessica’s eyes widened. “So you’re choosing to be the guardian rather than using it yourself.” 

“Someone has to stand at the threshold,” Tim said, his gaze drifting back to the fierce deity on the book’s cover. “Someone who understands both the technology we’ve built and the ancient wisdom it’s based on. And whoever takes on that task will have to be fierce and willing to make difficult decisions about who’s ready and who isn’t. Like the dharmapala.” 

Jessica stood up, stretching, and letting out a soft chuckle. “Well, I’m not wearing a necklace of skulls, it’d clash with my blazer,” she joked, a glimmer of lightness returned to her tone. “Give a lady a ride home?” 

Tim smiled, the tension in his chest easing just a bit as he grabbed his keys from the table. “Let’s go.”
