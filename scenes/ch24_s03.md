“This had to be a setup,” her partner muttered as they settled into the SUV. 

“The lawyers did seem to show up pretty quickly,” Gile admitted. The weight of exhaustion pressed down on her as she leaned back, eyes closing for a moment before opening again with a sigh. “And not just any lawyers. Half of Silicon Valley’s top firms, plus specialists in corporate defense, antitrust, securities…” She trailed off, remembering the blur of business cards and firm names. 

“Sato’s not just defending against us,” her partner said, his voice thoughtful. “Did you see the market alerts during the raid? Advent Industries started buying up shares in three of her subsidiary companies.” He pulled out his phone, scrolling through notifications. “The timing’s too perfect. While we’re searching for protocol hardware, someone’s trying to strip her of corporate assets.” 

Gile’s mouth tightened. “We’re law enforcement, not corporate raiders. O’Hearn’s using our investigation as cover for a hostile takeover.” 

“Above our pay grade,” her partner cut in, though his expression suggested he shared her unease. “But it explains why her defense was so… comprehensive. Those weren’t just protocol safeguards we saw today.” 

“Cray won’t care,” Gile said, rubbing her temples. “He’s so focused on the protocol, he probably hasn’t noticed we’re playing into someone else’s game.” 

Her partner’s response was interrupted by an alert on both their phones: “Georgia Sato Announces Emergency Board Meeting - Market Speculation Intensifies.” 

 “All I know,” Gile said looking up from her phone, “is if Cray thinks he’s pinning this on us when most of the intel came from his new bestie, Frank O’Hearn, he’s got another thing coming. This is going to look horrible for everyone involved.”
