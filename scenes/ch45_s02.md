His hand steadied as he pressed the call button. The phone rang once, twice, before O’Hearn’s voice buzzed through the speaker. 

“We’re going to war, O’Hearn,” Cray said, his tone low and deliberate. “No more half-measures. I want the protocol shut down, by any means necessary.” 

O’Hearn’s response hummed in his ear, a blur of words he barely registered. Cray’s gaze was fixed on the window, the city beyond reduced to a mesh of lights and motion. He wasn’t part of it anymore, not in the way he once was. He’d become something different, hardened, colder. 

He ended the call and set the phone down on the desk, its presence stark beside the face-down photograph. His fingers brushed the edge of the worn frame, but he didn’t turn it over. There was no need. He wasn’t fighting for them anymore, he was fighting for humanity. 

Outside, the sky deepened, and the city lights flickered like distant stars. Cray stared at them, catching a faint glimpse of his reflection fractured by the crack in the glass, and let the silence close in around him.
