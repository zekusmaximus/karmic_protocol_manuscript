Constance Henning walked into her office to find one of the FTC attorneys already there, seated with an air of calm that bordered on resignation. She slipped off her coat, draping it over the back of her chair, and met his eyes. “The announcement goes out at noon,” she said, her tone brisk. “How bad is the blowback likely to be?” 

The attorney leaned forward, the light catching on his glasses. “From the retreat center? Minimal. They got what they wanted. From Cray and Trout…” He shrugged, a slight lift of his shoulders that spoke volumes. “They’ll keep fighting through other channels.” 

Henning settled into her chair, the leather creaking slightly. The weight of the day pressed on her, but she kept her expression neutral. “They’re not wrong about the risks,” she said, voice measured. The reports had painted an unsettling picture, mass consciousness transformation, the kind that could upend the very fabric of society. “Destabilization isn’t just a possibility; it’s probable.” 

“Inevitable.” the attorney said, a rare hint of agreement in his voice. “But consumer protection regulations and device licensing won’t stop it. That window’s closed.” 

Henning’s gaze shifted to the framed citation on her wall. “So, we watch and wait?” she asked, her words steady, almost rhetorical. 

“We watch and document,” the lawyer replied, his tone taking on a clinical edge. “This time, we build the case the right way, through proper channels.” He hesitated, the pause sharpening her focus. 

“And?” she prompted. 

“Keep an eye on Cray and Trout,” he said, the quiet warning settling between them like an unwelcome guest. “They’re true believers that this protocol is the end of society as we know it. Those are always the most dangerous.” 

Henning nodded, the slow realization sinking in. Cray and Trout’s fervor could be an unpredictable force. “The protocol may be beyond our immediate control now,” she said, her voice low but firm. “But we can still control how we respond to it.” 

“Exactly.” The lawyer’s mouth quirked in a fleeting smile. “Sometimes the best move is to step back and let things play out. Especially when you’re holding a weak hand.” 

They spent the next hour with several staff and attorneys, outlining the plan, how to manage the announcement of the lifting of the cease and desist, handling press calls, brief key legislators. But as they worked, an unspoken understanding lingered. This was not an end, just a pause, a tactical retreat in a battle that was far from over. The protocol was loose in the world now, an entity beyond containment. All they could do was watch, wait, and brace for the fallout.
