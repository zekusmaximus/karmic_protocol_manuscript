Zach stood at the end of the assembly line, unable to suppress the awe tightening his chest as hundreds of virtual reality headsets glimmered under the overhead lights, each one waiting for its final programming. It felt surreal, almost impossible, even with the proof right in front of him. The “KP” etched into the side caught his eye—an unexpectedly refined touch, considering their compressed timeline. 

“Jesus Christ,” Zach murmured, taking a step back, the expletive slipping out as disbelief gave way to wonder. 

“Not exactly,” Tim said with a chuckle, lifting one headset and pressing it into Zach’s hands. From across the room, a news alert flashed on one of the monitors. “Advent Industries Calls Emergency Shareholder Meeting. Vote on Sato Tech Acquisition Expected.” 

Tim’s expression hardened before he gestured toward the assembly line. “We’ve got forty-eight hours before O’Hearn’s team of lawyers start filing their injunctions against any and all of Georgia’s holdings. Every minute counts.” 

Zach examined the device, turning it over in his hands as he and Tim walked along the assembly line. The surreal nature of the scene still clung to him, a lingering echo of the convoluted journey that had brought him here. The cab ride, the shift into a nondescript van, the circuitous drive that twisted through seemingly nowhere, and the final rush into the back of a box truck, all of it had felt like an elaborate smuggling operation. Now he understood it wasn’t just about avoiding government surveillance. 

“Are these the retinal scanners that are in the headsets?” Zach asked, catching sight of the lens station as they moved past it. 

“Yup,” Tim replied, a glint of pride in his eyes. “And those special audio components you wanted.” He gestured further down the line, where engineers worked meticulously. “Securing those wasn’t exactly quiet. This isn’t just an assembly line, Zach. Each unit goes through precise calibration, quantum sensors, neural interface testing, sub-millisecond response checks. One misaligned part, and the whole thing’s scrap. And we can’t afford delays, not with corporate lawyers and Homeland Security circling.” 

Zach nodded, the gesture automatic, before turning to the thick pane of glass that revealed another room with a complete microchip fabricator, something he’d only glimpsed on rare overseas trips with company executives. 

“Our clean room,” Tim said, his voice breaking through Zach’s reverie. “Slowest part of the process, and the hardest to keep supplied.” 

“No bulk microchip orders to trace,” Zach whispered, the realization settling over him like a revelation. It was barely believable they could put a fab like this together, yet here it was. 

“Plus, a helpful solar panel facility happened to have surplus silicon shipped off the books,” Tim added with a grin. 

“You’ve really thought of everything,” Zach said, genuine admiration threading through his voice. The irony hit him. Months ago, he’d have balked at such mass production, haunted by the memory of the raid on the retreat center that had been treated like a bomb factory. Losing his job and facing arrest had changed him; now, all he could feel was a sharp thrill coursing through his veins. 

“This must be costing a fortune!” Zach said, the enormity of the operation dawning on him. “Especially now with…” He trailed off, thinking of the market alerts he’d seen about O’Hearn’s aggressive stock purchases. 

“Courtesy of Ms. Sato,” Tim replied. A smile tugged at the corner of his mouth as he spoke, but his fingers drummed against the tabletop, his shoulders rigid beneath his casual shirt. “Through shell companies, straw men and a maze of financial defenses that’s getting more complex by the day. She’s fighting a war on two fronts. Keeping O’Hearn’s corporate raiders from tracking these resources while preventing government scrutiny from freezing her assets.” 

“The facility wasn’t built overnight,” Tim continued. Zach saw a look of pride mixing with urgency. “Georgia’s been quietly acquiring equipment and setting up the fabrication line since early 2026. Each component bought through different subsidiaries, shipped to various shell companies, finally brought here. But O’Hearn’s takeover attempt is forcing her to accelerate everything - moving assets, restructuring ownership, protecting supply chains. We’re in a race now.” 

Zach stepped closer to the fabrication equipment, the gleam of polished metal and intricate networks of wires drawing him in. “The silicon wafer processing alone must’ve taken weeks to calibrate. If O’Hearn gains control of her tech companies…” 

“Exactly,” Tim confirmed, a grim smile forming as he leaned against a nearby workstation. “That’s why we started the test runs three months ago, masked as solar panel production. The first chip that met our standards came off the line six weeks back, right when the heat started turning up at the retreat center. We knew we’d need a head start.” 

“And the custom audio components?” Zach asked, eyes shifting to the assembly line. 

Tim’s smile widened, though fatigue showed at its edges. “They’ve been in the works even longer. A small manufacturer in Arizona that Georgia took over last year has been handling those - one of the companies O’Hearn’s trying to acquire now. Everything’s been moving in parallel, but we’re running out of time. Once he gains enough board seats…” 

He left the implications hanging. Zach couldn’t help but admire the intricate dance Georgia was performing, using corporate structures to shield the protocol while preventing those same structures from falling into hostile hands.
