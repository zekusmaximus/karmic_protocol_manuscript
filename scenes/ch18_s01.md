Tim sat in a hotel room, waiting for Finn to returned from checking things at the retreat center. A sharp knock at the door interrupted his thoughts. He crossed the room with practiced ease and opened it, eyes narrowing as Jessica entered, balancing a tray of coffees. 

“Nice hotel, Tim. Didn’t know you went in for this kind of luxury,” she remarked, placing the tray on the small counter near the entrance. Tim’s lips twitched, acknowledging the subtle jab without a reply, it was clearly not a nice hotel. 

“Jessica, good to see you. How are things at the warehouse?” Tim’s voice was even, but he scrutinized her face for any sign of trouble.  

“Per your cryptic orders, I didn’t stop there,” Jessica said, taking a cautious sip. Her tone was laced with curiosity. “Why are we meeting here, anyway?” 

Tim allowed a smile to surface. “Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you,” he said, a hint of humor in his voice as he reached for the TV remote and switched it off. Silence hummed between them for a moment. 

“Any news?” Jessica’s question cut through the pause as he sank onto the sofa. Tim caught her eyes flicker with unease. 

“Nope,” Tim replied, pulling out the rolling chair from the desk and sitting down. 

“No news is good news, right?” Jessica offered, but Tim wasn’t ready to let his guard down. 

“Not necessarily,” Tim countered, letting the coffee warm his hands before taking a deliberate sip. “Are we still on track to start the first production run this week?” His tone brooked no uncertainty. 

“Yes indeed. How is the software piece coming along?” Jessica’s question was direct, and Tim noted the slight shift in his stance, as if anticipating a problem. 

“Swimmingly,” Tim said, a brief nod toward the desk where two laptops sat, programs running ceaselessly. The subtle hum of technology pulsed in the room.  

He looked at Jessica with a hint of pride in his smile. The two of them, alongside Finn, made up the core group they called the dharmapalas, protectors of the protocol. They had allies—volunteers from Jeta’s Grove, others from the retreat center, and trusted friends—but here, in this room, was the heart of their mission. 

Their task was twofold: mass-produce the karmic protocol and defend it from those who would suppress it. This was imperative to ensure that anyone who wanted enlightenment could attain it. 

Jessica’s gaze sharpened as she changed topics, launching into her real report. “It didn’t take long for my position in policy at the state senate to bear fruit,” she began, eyes flicking briefly to Tim. “A friend in the Governor’s office just tipped me off, they’ve been briefed about an imminent danger involving an untested virtual reality program. Apparently, it uses stolen technology to scramble people’s brains.” 

Tim’s jaw tightened. “Scramble people’s brains? Stolen technology?” 

Who stole technology? Tim thought. 

“Briefed by who?” Tim’s question cut through the room. 

Jessica’s gaze was steady, but the news seemed to weigh on the room. “Briefed by none other than the Department of Homeland Security,” she said. “I don’t have any materials, and I’m not likely to get access. It’s not an issue for the legislature yet. I only know what my friend has heard, and it’s not good.” 

Tim’s mind worked fast, cataloging possibilities. Jessica’s voice dropped an octave as she continued. “Homeland Security has one of the retreat center’s awakened ones. I’m not sure which one, but apparently, whoever it is has been cooperating with the investigation.” 

“Probably not cooperating as much as being open and honest,” Tim said, the words coming out as more of a grim acknowledgment than surprise. His jaw clenched subtly; this was a complication they couldn’t afford. 

Tim’s hand tightened on the arm of the chair, his concern growing as he continued. “They already had my name from the conference,” he said, the edge in his voice giving way to a resigned sigh. “This confirms my paranoia.” 

Jessica’s eyes widened. “Hence why you’re staying here and not going to either the retreat center or the manufacturing facility lately.” 

“I’d better warn Finn!” Tim’s abrupt exclamation made her gaze snapped up. She watched Tim fumble for his phone, urgency taking hold of the room. 

“Oh boy,” Tim said, cutting into the tension. He met Jessica’s eyes with a sharp nod. “Best he doesn’t come here or go to the facility, not straight from the retreat center, at least. If they have eyes on the place, we can’t afford that risk.” 

His fingers were already dialing, his movements jerky with nervous energy. Tim noticed Jessica holding her breath, the new reality sinking in.  

Tim rubbed a hand over his eyes, fatigue battling with adrenaline. He took another sip of his coffee as he waited for Finn to answer, the lukewarm liquid doing little to steady him.  

Jessica pulled off the baseball cap she’d been wearing, and her long, curly brown hair cascaded around her shoulders. Tim caught the hint of defiance in her mock salute as she started to talk again as he waited on the phone. “Homeland Security isn’t the only agency involved. They’re labeling it an unlicensed medical device, claiming the tech and code were stolen from some big VR company, and that it’s illegally gathering biometric data on the populace.” 

Tim’s outburst was immediate. “What a bunch of crap! On all counts!” He waved his phone, frustration etched across his face. “Finn’s not picking up.” 

“We can’t count on any of these agencies to hold to the truth if their goal is to shut down the protocol,” he said, his voice measured but firm. The weight of the situation pressed on him, demanding clarity. “We need to contact Georgia and ensure the production facility is secure. They probably think Zach stole the tech from his own company. If we can’t reach Finn, maybe we should reach out to Carly and check if any of these agencies have been in touch with her.” 

Jessica set down her coffee, the ceramic clinking sharply against the table. She began pacing, the lines on her face deepening with worry. “This is really happening, they are really rounding up people involved.” she muttered, disbelief mixing with fear. 

Tim took a step toward her, a laugh breaking through his tension. He slung an arm around Jessica’s shoulders. “We planned for this,” he said, the smile forced but necessary. The reassurance lingered in the air like a promise they both wanted to believe. Yet beneath that thin veneer, Tim knew they hadn’t planned for coordinated action against the protocol to come this soon or with this level of threat. 

Tim’s phone buzzed, sharp and urgent, pulling their attention. Relief and apprehension flickered across his face as he glanced at the screen. “It’s Finn,” he announced before connecting the call. Jessica fell silent, eyes locked on Tim as he listened, brows knitting tighter with each passing second. 

“Homeland Security did what?” Tim’s voice rose, echoing their collective anxiety as the torrent of Finn’s words flooded the line.
