“The question before us,” Chairwoman Roberts began, her voice carrying the weight of decades on the Hill, “is whether we can find a middle path.” 

Bud Turner felt the tension seep into his bones as the afternoon light slanted through the windows of Roberts’ private office. He caught the distant echo of raised voices from the street below, a clash of anger and desperation bleeding into the otherwise insulated room. Even here, on the Hill, the unraveling felt too close. He glanced around at the drawn faces gathered at the long mahogany table. This wasn’t just another policy debate. Bud knew what was at stake: the steady unspooling of society itself, threaded in every conversation, every step they took toward an uncertain future. They stood on the precipice, staring down the irreversible. 

“The news cycle is already calling it the Great Walkout,” Cray said, his tone razor-sharp. “Doctors, pilots, truck drivers, entire systems grinding to a halt as more people ‘wake up.’ This isn’t just a disruption; it’s a collapse. There is no middle path,” Cray said, his voice jagged as his shoes tapped rhythmically on the polished floor. Bud’s eyes followed Cray’s restless pacing; the man hadn’t settled into a chair once. The urgency in Cray’s tone resonated in Bud’s own chest. “Every day we delay action; more people are being influenced by this unregulated technology.” 

Bud’s gaze shifted to Senator Yost as she leaned forward, eyes sharp. “Influenced?” she repeated, her tone edged with challenge. “The FDA’s own data shows unprecedented improvements in mental health outcomes. These people aren’t being controlled; they’re being freed.” 

Freed. Bud’s mind caught on the word, considering its double edge. Did freedom truly mean liberation, or was it a dangerous abandonment of what held society together? The question hovered over the room, unspoken but undeniable. 

Frank O’Hearn’s hands gripped the table edge, knuckles tight and pale. Bud watched O’Hearn’s jaw tighten before he spoke. “Freedom to abandon their responsibilities, their families,” O’Hearn said, voice thick with bitterness. 

Henning’s quiet voice cut through the moment, drawing Bud’s attention. She rarely spoke during these meetings, and when she did, it was like a pin dropping in a silent hall. “Their conditioning,” she corrected, eyes calm but unwavering. Bud felt the room still, every person listening intently. She had struck at the heart of the matter, an idea they all skirted around. “Perhaps what we’re really afraid of is a population that can’t be manipulated by the usual incentives.” 

Bud’s pulse quickened as Cray’s frustration flared again. “That’s exactly my point,” Cray shot back, the muscles in his jaw flexing. “The entire fabric of society, everything we rely on to function, will start coming apart. And it will happen too fast for anyone to control.” 

Bud glanced at Roberts, who remained impassive but subtly nodded. Her measured voice broke the silence. “Or,” she said, “it’s evolving. The question is whether we guide that evolution or waste resources fighting it.” Bud’s chest tightened. He understood, perhaps more than most, that this was not just policy they were weighing; it was the cost of releasing an algorithm, a key that could pry open minds in ways that could alter everything. 

Roberts’ gaze landed on the FTC attorney, and Bud noted the slight shift in their posture, a flicker of unease that mirrored Bud’s own internal disquiet. “What’s the FTC’s current position?” Roberts asked. 

Bud’s eyes stayed on the attorney, catching the barely perceptible sigh before he responded. “Legally, we’re on shaky ground,” he said, his voice low but steady. “You can’t regulate a technology solely because it makes people less interested in consuming. It’s not coercion by any legal standard. No harm, no foul, as they say.” 

No harm. The words reverberated in Bud Turner’s mind, though a deep, gnawing doubt told him it wasn’t quite that simple. The Karmic Protocol was changing people. But was it harm? Or was it something more complex, something Bud wasn’t ready to confront? 

He caught sight of Jessica Everett, her pen moving across the page in smooth, deliberate strokes. Bud could tell she wasn’t taking the formal minutes of the meeting; instead, it looked like she was brainstorming, setting down notes meant for another time, another purpose. 

Bud shifted uneasily, his mind drifting from the urgent voices around him to the sleek, black headset waiting at home. George’s newfound calm should have brought Bud relief, but it gnawed at him instead. His son wasn’t just sleeping better, he was quieter, detached, as if something essential had shifted beneath the surface. Had technology truly helped his son, or had it simply altered something fundamental? Perhaps Henning was right, perhaps people were becoming aware of a reality that had been overlooked. But as Bud’s gaze moved from face-to-face around the room, he realized they weren’t all waking up at the same pace. 

“What if we’re asking the wrong questions?” The words left Bud’s mouth before he had fully realized he was speaking. The solid weight of his voice surprised even him; he seldom contributed to these sessions. 

Heads turned, eyes wide with surprise. 

“What if this isn’t about control or regulation,” he continued, noticing the tight atmosphere in the room, “but about readiness?” 

“Readiness for what?” O’Hearn’s reply came quickly and sharply, a challenge. 

Before Bud could frame an answer, Henning spoke up, her tone quiet yet resolute. “For enlightenment,” she said. Bud watched as she stood and moved to the window, turning her back to them as she gazed out. “The world’s waking up, Frank. Not because we’re pushing it, but because it’s time.” 

Bud’s eyes followed hers to the scene outside, where the city pulsed with chaos, beginning to play out the seismic shifts debated in the quiet confines of this room. An awareness that couldn’t be unlearned. 

Roberts’ silence increased the tension in the room until she finally spoke. “I will not recommend further hearings or investigations. The committee’s resources are better spent studying the implications than pursuing restrictions.” 

Bud noticed Cray’s mouth open, ready to protest, but Yost’s voice cut in, weary and resigned. “The vote would go against you anyway, Lawrence.” There was something almost nostalgic in his tone, as if he felt the subtle shift of an era passing.
