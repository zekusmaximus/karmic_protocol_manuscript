Zach flicked on the television, the screen casting a faint blue glow across the darkened room. A stern-faced anchor filled the air with an urgency Zach had grown too tired to feel. 

“Breaking News from Wall Street: Major investment firm Blackstone announces a temporary trading suspension amid key staff departures. Sources report senior traders have resigned without notice. Meanwhile, a major fast-food franchise has quietly suspended operations at three locations, citing ‘staffing irregularities.’ In Silicon Valley, tech giant Oracle faces internal upheaval as development teams have…” 

The voice trailed off in Zach’s mind as he rubbed his temples, but the words lingered like static, prickling the edge of his attention. Zach flipped the channel to the hearing, fingers wrapped around a mug of coffee that had long gone cold. He’d declined the invitation to testify, following the advice of his lawyer. The criminal case was nearly over, but the civil suit loomed, unresolved. Still, he knew this hearing wasn’t about finding the truth. Not as he saw Cray’s grandstanding. 

“When multiplied across thousands, or millions, of participants, the consequences are catastrophic.” Cray said, his voice rising to a pitch that grated on Zach’s nerves. 

Zach shifted on the couch as Roberts announced the speaker. “Next up is the recently appointed Director of Digital Ministry Studies at First Life Church.” 

The director walked to the table with a composed solemnity, the kind that came with years of speaking to congregations. Zach’s brow furrowed; he’d heard of this guy before. The man had a reputation for dramatics. 

“Members of the committee,” he started, his voice quivering with what Zach immediately recognized as calculated emotion, “this device is nothing less than a tool for dismantling divine order.” 

As the First Life Church director began his testimony, Zach’s eyes drifted to the news crawls at the bottom of the screen. The scrolling text felt like a drumbeat, each headline striking deeper than the last: 

“NASDAQ halts trading in major tech stocks amid executive departures” 

“FBI reports growing several agents ‘unfit for active duty’ after extended leave” 

“Major media networks struggling with staff retention crisis” 

He sighed, sinking further into his chair. The director’s voice buzzed in the background, righteous and defiant, but Zach couldn’t shake the feeling that the world outside the hearing was far ahead of these debates. They weren’t stopping a storm, they were drowning in it. 

Zach’s grip on the remote tightened. The words felt like an invocation, each one laid out to strike chords of fear. 

“Could you elaborate on how it separates people from their faith?” Representative Green’s voice was steady, cutting through the theatrics. 

“Certainly,” the director said, leaning in as if delivering a sermon. “We’ve documented numerous cases of individuals abandoning their traditional religious practices after using this device. They claim to have ‘seen through’ their previous beliefs, to have found what they call ‘direct experience’ of spiritual truth.” The scorn in his tone was palpable, and Zach’s lips thinned.  

“But isn’t that their right under the First Amendment?” Green’s response came swift and pointed, and Zach couldn’t help but nod slightly. At least someone was still asking the tough questions. 

Zach’s gaze remained fixed on the screen as the director spoke, each word deliberately chosen to evoke fear. “Of course, but this isn’t a natural spiritual journey guided by proper religious authority. This is a technological shortcut that bypasses traditional paths to salvation. It promises enlightenment without the necessary foundation of faith, without proper spiritual guidance, without…” a pause drew out, “without the divine grace that true spiritual transformation requires.” 

Zach felt a twist of frustration coil in his chest. He didn’t know the committee well enough to recognize which members would latch onto such rhetoric. Representative Miller leaned forward, his eyes sharp. “Are you suggesting there’s only one valid path to spiritual truth, director?” 

“Not at all,” he responded smoothly, but Zach caught the flicker of hesitation before he continued. “I’m merely pointing out that throughout human history, legitimate spiritual awakening has always come through established religious traditions. Our Lord himself spent forty days in the desert, he didn’t put on a headset for fifteen minutes.” 

“Thank you, director,” Roberts said abruptly, impatience seeping into his voice. “I believe we’ve heard enough about theological implications…” 

The screen shifted to an attorney at the FTC, hand raised as he was sworn in. Zach reached for the remote and turned up the volume, needing to hear every word. 

“Consumer markets are already showing unprecedented shifts. Luxury goods sales have plummeted 60% this quarter. Social media engagement is down 40%. Traditional advertising metrics have become unreliable as enlightened consumers simply stop responding to marketing stimuli.” 

Zach’s lips twitched into a half-smile. He remembered the ads that used to light up his screens, gilded watches, sleek cars, vacations to nowhere. They all seemed absurd now, relics of a world that had believed in its own permanence. 

Zach’s eyes flicked to the screen, taking in the tension in Cray’s expression as he sat behind the witness table, barely masking his frustration. The attorney’s measured testimony grated on Cray, that much was obvious even without sound. But Zach knew that what bothered Cray most was the FTC’s steady, academic approach. It lacked the fire he craved, the urgency that might incite immediate action. 

“We have documented cases of individuals abandoning careers, withdrawing investments, severing economic relationships,” the attorney continued. The words were precise, deliberate, but Zach could sense they lacked the punch Cray wanted. “While these choices may be voluntary, their cumulative effect…” 

“Thank you,” Chairman Roberts cut in, his tone brisk. 

Zach watched as the director returned to his seat, a subtle smirk flickering across his face. He noted the committee members leaning toward their aides, murmuring. The hearing was meant to steer toward public safety and consumer protection, but the overt sermonizing and sterile testimony of the FTC had muddied the waters. Even Cray’s jaw was set, eyes narrowed, not just at the bias, but likely at the strategic blunder it represented. 

The hearing droned on, but Zach’s focus wavered. The crawls, the voices, the endless parsing of consequences, they all blurred together. This wasn’t a debate about the protocol anymore, not really. It was a requiem for a world that no longer existed, even if no one was ready to admit it yet.
