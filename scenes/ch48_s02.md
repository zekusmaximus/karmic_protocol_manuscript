Alone once more, Frank slumped into his chair, a long, tired breath escaping him. His gaze drifted to the framed photo on the edge of the desk. A trip to Ireland, years past, flashed before him, the Cliffs of Moher towering in the background, wind whipping at their clothes. His wife stood with one hand clutching her hat, their children doubled over in laughter as the hat soared away, swallowed by the cliff’s edge, and lost to the sky. The memory played like a warm current, and for a brief moment, it dulled the sharp tension coiled inside him. 

He brushed his fingertips over the glass, a faint smile fading as quickly as it came. This was what he was truly fighting for. Not the chairmanship, not the recognition that came with it, but a future in which his children could grow up unburdened by the allure of synthetic enlightenment, a world where they would strive, stumble, and succeed on their own terms. 

His jaw clenched as he shifted his thoughts to the hearings. The congressional spectacle had failed to stir the public outrage he had anticipated.  

Frank’s mind turned to his last conversation with Cray. He was one of the few allies left, someone who understood what they were up against. 

Trout was beginning to cool off now that the political winds had shifted. Even the reverend and the director, still useful but too preoccupied with the religious angle, were missing the bigger picture. None of them grasped the true magnitude of what was at stake. 

Let the Board strip him of his chairmanship. He didn’t need it. The private sector had always been more adept at confronting threats that the government either couldn’t or wouldn’t face. All he required now was irrefutable proof that production was restarting, something tangible enough for Cray to leverage into real action at Homeland Security. 

A soft chime from his computer signaled the reminder for the Board meeting. Frank tugged at his tie, adjusting it with the precision of a soldier readying for battle. If they believed that ousting him would put an end to his crusade, they were about to learn just how mistaken they were. 

His eyes fell one last time on the family photo. The memory of the wind snatching his wife’s hat flashed through his mind, but with it came the sound of her laughter, carefree and resilient, already imagining a better one to replace it. The loss had been fleeting, a reminder that when something was taken, it simply meant finding another way forward. 

Frank squared his shoulders as he moved to the office door. The Board was waiting. They could strip him of his title, but they couldn’t stop what was coming.
