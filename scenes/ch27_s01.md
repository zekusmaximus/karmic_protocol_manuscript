The room was dimly lit, just the way Georgia had planned. Heavy fabric draped over the windows blocked any view from outside, ensuring their privacy. The few low lamps scattered around the private retreat house cast enough light to create an intimate, almost conspiratorial atmosphere. 

Georgia stood at the front, arms crossed, scanning the small gathering of individuals seated on leather chairs and meditation cushions. Each face was scrutinized, their presence was no accident. She had chosen them with care, people with the influence to help and the discretion to keep this gathering secret. They were already familiar with the the Karmic Protocol, and some had shown genuine interest. 

“This is not a public unveiling,” she said, her voice steady and deliberate. Georgia resisted the urge to check her phone, knowing another barrage of urgent messages about O’Hearn’s latest market moves awaited her attention. “What we’re about to share with you cannot, under any circumstances, be discussed outside of this room. Time is no longer our luxury.” 

Tim stood nearby. The air between them was thick with unspoken understanding. They both knew how pivotal this moment was - not just for the protocol, but for keeping it out of O’Hearn’s grasp. 

“The Karmic Protocol has been fully developed. We’ve achieved what we set out to do, and more. Mass production has begun, using only our resources.” Georgia’s gaze swept over the select group. “This isn’t about seeking investors or public approval. This is about bringing the technology to the people, quietly, and quickly.” 

A woman near the back, one whose eyes had been tracking the recent corporate warfare in the markets, raised her hand. “So why are we here?” Her voice carried the edge of someone accustomed to direct answers. “What’s our role in all of this?” 

Georgia stepped forward before Tim could respond. “You’re here because we need trusted partners to help us distribute the Karmic Protocol on our terms. Quietly, carefully.” She met the woman’s gaze, letting her confidence anchor her words. “This isn’t about mass market appeal or tech conferences. We have full funding to operate under the radar, for now. What we need is a network, a discreet pathway to reach any who will benefit from this without drawing unwanted attention before certain corporate interests can gain control of our distribution channels.” 

She stepped aside, her pulse quickening as Tim moved forward, the small black device cradled in his hands. He lifted the neural interface headset for all to see, and she noted the subtle shift in the room as their attention locked onto it. 

“This,” Tim said, his voice cutting through the murmured anticipation, “is the key to something the world has never seen before. We’ve built a system to fundamentally change human consciousness, to accelerate enlightenment, break the chains of attachment, and reveal the true nature of reality.” Georgia’s gaze swept over the group, catching the brief flashes of recognition and understanding. These were the moments she thrived in, the realization in their eyes. They knew what this could mean. 

Tim’s words carried on. “But we don’t need to explain what that means to you. You already understand the power behind this.” 

The room buzzed with murmurs, and Georgia’s fingers twitched as she resisted the urge to interject. She needed them to process this. To see beyond their immediate questions.  

She felt the shift in the room, the subtle nods, the spark of agreement catching fire. They were starting to understand. 

The financier leaned forward, his expression a mixture of intrigue and concern. Georgia could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he spoke. “You’re asking us to distribute technology that can fundamentally alter human consciousness. Tech that may soon be outlawed if it isn’t already. More importantly, how do we ensure it won’t be commercialized or used for corporate gain? There’s a huge market for cognitive enhancement tech, companies may kill to get their hands on this.” 

Georgia’s gaze flickered to Tim, noting the way his jaw tightened. She recognized the telltale sign of his simmering frustration. “That’s exactly what we’re avoiding,” he said, his voice clipped but controlled. “This isn’t a product to be sold to the highest bidder. We’ve built it to prevent misuse, quantum encryption, individualized neural patterns, quantum fail-safes that make it impossible to copy or mass-produce without our direct oversight. We don’t intend to let it be exploited by governments or tech giants.” 

Georgia’s eyes shifted to a woman known for her deep connections in the tech world. The sharp glint in her eyes showed she was assessing more than just the words; she was probing for weaknesses. “But even if you don’t sell it, how long do you think you can keep this a secret?” she asked, leaning forward. “People already know the protocol exists, even if the government believes they’ve suppressed it, which I’m not entirely sure they do. Once units are seen in the open, once people truly realize you’ve cracked this code, the demand may be unstoppable. Companies and governments alike are pouring billions into AI-driven neural interfaces. How do you plan to keep them at bay?” 

Georgia held her breath for a moment. She caught Tim’s eye, a silent acknowledgment passing between them before she turned back to the group. “That’s why we’re being extremely selective,” she said, each word deliberate. 

She focused on the room, ensuring her voice carried not just authority but conviction. “We know the risks of AI commercialization. We’ve seen how quickly new technologies are commodified, twisted into something unrecognizable. This is different. The Karmic Protocol is about liberation, not control. But make no mistake, if we lose control of this, it could be used in ways we never intended. That’s why discretion is everything, particularly with this first production run.” 

A heavy silence followed her words, and Georgia could feel the tension knotting in the room, winding tighter with every second. These were businesspeople accustomed to navigating cutting-edge technologies and the complex networks surrounding them, but the stakes here were higher than anything they had encountered before. 

A voice from the back, a man seated near the window whose sharp eyes hadn’t missed a detail, pierced the silence. “Your stock lost twelve percent today,” he stated flatly. “Advent is positioned to gain three board seats by month’s end. The world’s already struggling to regulate AI systems that manipulate our behaviors online, and you’ve created something that goes even deeper. How do you distribute this technology when you might lose control of your own companies?” 

Georgia’s attention snapped to him, recognizing the financier, whose hedge fund had quietly supported several of her ventures. His question cut to the heart of their accelerated timeline. 

“That’s precisely why this meeting is happening now,” Tim interjected, his voice steady but urgent. “We’re also racing against corporate consolidation. Once these units are distributed, they can’t be recalled or controlled by anyone, including whoever might end up controlling our companies.” 

The financier leaned forward, skepticism etched on his face. “You can’t fight market forces forever. Advent is offering a forty percent premium to shareholders. The pressure to sell will become overwhelming.” 

Georgia didn’t flinch. “We’re not trying to fight market forces,” she said, her voice carrying quiet authority. “We’re ensuring this technology reaches the right hands before those forces can contain it. Each of you was chosen not just for your influence, but for your understanding of what’s at stake. When O’Hearn moves to seize control of our tech assets, he’ll find the most valuable one has already slipped through his fingers.” 

“And if his lawyers freeze your assets before distribution?” the financier pressed. “They’ve already filed preliminary injunctions.” 

A subtle smile crossed Georgia’s face. “Corporate assets can be frozen. But you can’t freeze awakening.” She gestured to Tim, who revealed the sleek black headset. “The first wave is ready. We have a narrow window, days, not weeks. That’s why we need partners who can act decisively, while the corporate world is focused on stock prices and board seats.” 

Another voice changed the subject, seeming to relieve some of Tim’s tension. “The world’s already struggling to regulate AI systems that manipulate our behaviors online. You’ve created something that goes even deeper, something that can reshape consciousness itself. How do you avoid the same ethical pitfalls? How do you prevent this from becoming another tool for control, another way for corporations to hijack the human mind?” 

Tim’s sigh broke through the tense quiet, but Georgia felt the weight of his response like a shared burden. “We’ve built the protocol with every possible safeguard,” he said, each word weighed with unspoken concerns. Georgia’s pulse quickened as he continued, “But we’re aware of the ethical complexities. We have done everything possible to protect it from the risks of misuse. That’s why we need to to do our best to keep it out of the mainstream, away from the corporate and government machines that would inevitably try to commercialize it or weaponize it.” 

The financier, who had been quiet since his last question, shook his head slowly. Georgia could almost feel his doubt in the air between them. “You can’t fight demand. No matter what safeguards you have, once word gets out, people will want this, badly. And once the general public knows what it can do, the pressure to sell it will become overwhelming. Are you really prepared to go against the tide of not only the entire tech industry but our very system of capitalism?” 

Without a flicker of doubt Georgia stepped forward. The room shifted slightly as she commanded their attention. “We’re not naive. We know the challenges. But this technology can elevate human consciousness, not trap it in the same systems of exploitation and control that govern the rest of the tech world and society.  

The silence that followed was thick, punctuated only by the faint hum of the lamps. Georgia watched the financier, noting the subtle shift in his posture, the way the guarded skepticism in his eyes gave way to consideration. Finally, he nodded, the gesture slow but deliberate. “If you’re going to pull this off, you’ll need allies, people who can keep this hidden while navigating the undercurrents of corporate greed and regulatory pressure. Count me in.” 

Tim’s shoulders eased, and Georgia felt a small surge of relief ripple through her. His voice was measured, but she sensed the unspoken agreement between them as he spoke. “We’re not trying to start a revolution,” he said. Georgia knew he was speaking for them both. “But we are trying to make sure that when the world finally catches on to what we’ve built, it’s ready for it, and that it can’t be turned against the very people it was designed to help.”
