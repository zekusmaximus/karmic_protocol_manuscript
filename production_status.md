# THE KARMIC PROTOCOL - Production Status

**Project Goal:** Restructure 55-chapter manuscript into speculative-fiction techno-thriller with Chapter 24 (tablet factory raid) as Act I opening to hook agents in first 3 chapters.

**Target:** Big Five publisher query-ready manuscript (Spring 2025)

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED MILESTONES

### Infrastructure
- [x] GitHub repo created: `karmic_protocol_manuscript`
- [x] Full manuscript uploaded: `full_manuscript.md` (4,534 lines)
- [x] `/scenes` folder structure established
- [x] Parse manuscript script created and executed
- [x] **119 individual scene files generated** with YAML metadata headers
- [x] Chapter map generated: `chapter_map.md`
- [x] Scenes inventory created: `scenes_inventory.md` (comprehensive reference)

### Analysis & Planning
- [x] All scenes extracted with: chapter, POV, location, wordcount, auto-generated plot_function, thematic_tags
- [x] Character arc anchors identified (Bud, Fiona, Tim, Georgia, Sherry)
- [x] Thematic throughlines mapped:
  - **Primary:** Enlightenment vs. institutional control, systemic collapse as precondition, personal awakening vs. loyalty
  - **Character intrigue (not structural):** O'Hearn/Cray/Fiona subplot (complicity, corruption, hollow victories)
  - **Secondary:** Love & personal connection amid systemic chaos
- [x] Key scenes flagged: Chapter 24 (raid) and Chapter 33 (Sherry interrogation) as pivotal moments
- [x] **Vision document locked:** `vision_revised.md` with three-layer conflict clarified

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Current Session Goals

1. **‚úÖ Vision.md locked and revised:**
   - Three-layer conflict clarified (enlightenment vs. control, systemic collapse, personal awakening)
   - O'Hearn subplot reframed as character intrigue (complicity/corruption), not major conflict layer
   - Thematic depth defined: transcendence vs. power, capitalism's incompatibility with awakening
   - Comp titles identified: *Ministry for the Future*, *Blindsight*, *The Peripheral*, *The Insider*, *Severance*
   - Ending tone: Transcendent but not triumphant, bittersweet irrevocability

2. **‚è≥ Build restructuring map:**
   - Identify essential Act I scenes (Ch 24 + supporting backfill)
   - Mark which scenes to compress, cut, or reposition
   - Create old-chapter ‚Üí new-position mapping
   - Calculate new word count impact per act
   - Target: Act I = ~50 pages (~15K words)

3. **‚è≥ Draft opening 50 pages:**
   - New Chapter 1: Ch 24_S01-03 (raid sequence, cold open)
   - Strategic backfill: Ch 22 (raid planning), Ch 23 (team unity), compressed Ch 2 (Bud's crisis setup)
   - Establish three-layer conflict immediately (personal, institutional, metaphysical)
   - Show O'Hearn intrigue without overemphasizing it

---

## ‚è≥ UPCOMING PHASES

### Phase 2: Structural Revision
- [ ] Compress Chapters 1-23 into ~30 pages of strategic exposition (from current ~50K words)
- [ ] Reorder scenes according to new act structure:
  - **Act I:** Ch 24 raid + backfill (50 pages / ~15K words)
  - **Act II:** Ch 25-34 repositioned as Ch 2-12 (government/corporate response, protocol spread)
  - **Act III:** Ch 35-55 repositioned as Ch 13-33 (systemic collapse, resolution)
- [ ] Generate new full manuscript from restructured scene files
- [ ] First pass: ensure pacing, tension, and thematic coherence

### Phase 3: Prose Revision
- [ ] Line-edit opening act (50 pages) for agent impact
- [ ] Tighten philosophical passages so they deepen tension, not slow it
- [ ] Cut redundancy across character POVs
- [ ] Strengthen high-tension scenes (raids, interrogations, confrontations, systemic breakdown)
- [ ] Ensure O'Hearn subplot enriches character arcs without distorting structural clarity

### Phase 4: Query Prep
- [ ] Refine logline to 1-2 sentences
- [ ] Write 1-page synopsis (plot + thematic weight)
- [ ] Document 5-7 comp titles with brief positioning
- [ ] Draft query letter hook
- [ ] Prepare 10-page sample from new opening
- [ ] Author bio emphasizing speculative-fiction credentials + legal/institutional authority

### Phase 5: Beta Reading & Final Polish
- [ ] Solicit feedback from 2-3 readers (literary fiction + thriller backgrounds preferred)
- [ ] Address structural feedback
- [ ] Final copyedit pass
- [ ] Submission-ready manuscript

## üéØ SUCCESS METRICS

### Query Package Components
1. **Logline:** One sentence capturing hook + conflict + stakes
2. **Opening 50 pages:** Raid sequence + backfill showcasing tone, voice, structural complexity
3. **1-page synopsis:** Plot distillation + thematic weight (no spoilers for query, full synopsis for submission)
4. **Comp titles:** 5-7 positioned with precision (not "X meets Y" but "readers of X will appreciate...")
5. **Author bio:** Speculative-fiction attorney with thematic authority on institutional power, consciousness tech ethics

### Agent Targets
- **Big Five imprints:** Literary fiction with sci-fi crossover appeal (e.g., Knopf, FSG, Scribner)
- **Genre crossover agents:** Reps who handle literary thrillers, speculative literary fiction
- **Streaming potential:** High-concept hook + visual spectacle + philosophical depth = adaptation-friendly

## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

### Scene Reference Protocol
- **Format:** `ch##_s##` (e.g., `ch24_s02` for Chapter 24, Scene 2)
- **Inventory:** Use `scenes_inventory_revised.md` for plot function, thematic tags, character arcs
- **Dependencies:** Populate `links` field in scene YAML headers during restructuring

### Restructuring Philosophy
- **Reversible:** All changes use file moves, not deletions‚Äîoriginal structure preserved
- **Iterative:** Build restructuring map first, then execute scene reordering, then prose revision
- **Vision-aligned:** Every cut/compression decision checked against `vision_revised.md` for thematic coherence

### O'Hearn Subplot Handling
- **Scenes to preserve:** Ch 10-11, 15, 24_S03, 26, 30_S01, 38, 43
- **Function:** Deepens Fiona's defection arc, shows institutional corruption, gives O'Hearn hollow victory
- **Treatment in restructure:** Keep scenes lean, ensure they serve character development without distracting from primary conflict (Protocol vs. institutions)

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Create restructuring map** showing:
   - Old chapter ‚Üí new position
   - Scenes to keep, compress, cut
   - Word count per act
   - Dependencies between scenes

2. **Draft opening 50 pages:**
   - Page 1: Ch 24_S01 (Fiona en route to raid)
   - Pages 2-15: Ch 24_S02-03 (raid unfolds, spectacle, betrayal)
   - Pages 16-25: Ch 22_S01 + quick backfill (raid planning context, Fiona's perspective)
   - Pages 26-35: Ch 23_S01-02 + compressed Ch 2 (team dynamics, Bud's moral crisis setup)
   - Pages 36-50: Ch 26_S01-04 + Ch 33_S01 (market chaos, Georgia's response, government desperation)

3. **Validate restructuring decisions:**
   - Cross-reference with `vision_revised.md` to ensure thematic alignment
   - Check character arcs for continuity
   - Verify three-layer conflict visible from Page 1

**Estimated Time Remaining This Session:** 60-90 minutes  
**Outcome Goal:** Restructuring map complete + opening 50 pages drafted + comp research initiated
