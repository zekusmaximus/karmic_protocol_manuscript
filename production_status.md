## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Next Session Goals
1. **Lock down vision.md:**
   - Finalize core DNA and logline
   - Define thematic depth (what is this book *really* about?)
   - Confirm tone markers (thrilling + cerebral/philosophical)
   - Research and document comp titles (after vision locked)

2. **Build restructuring map:**
   - Identify essential Act I scenes (Ch 24 + supporting)
   - Mark which scenes to compress, cut, or reposition
   - Create old-chapter ‚Üí new-position mapping
   - Calculate new word count impact

3. **Draft opening 50 pages:**
   - New Chapter 1: Ch 24_S01 (Fiona en route to raid)
   - Continue through raid sequence (24_S02-03)
   - Backfill key exposition: team setup, Bud's moral crisis, corporate threat
   - Establish three-layer conflict immediately
