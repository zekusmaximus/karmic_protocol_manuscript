The convoy of black SUVs cut through pre-dawn fog like a surgical blade, their headlights carving tunnels through gray. Agent Fiona Gile sat in the rear vehicle, running through the operational brief one final time: suspected manufacturing facility for devices banned under three international treaties, high probability of evidence destruction, possible resistance. Her hand checked her sidearm—twenty years of federal enforcement had made the gesture automatic, a habit that had saved her life twice.
"Gate's open," her partner's voice crackled through comms.
Gile's gut tightened. 5:47 AM, and the facility's entrance stood wide like an invitation. Gates didn't open themselves, and innocent operations didn't unseal their perimeters before business hours.
"Any vehicles enter before our arrival?"
"Box truck to the loading dock, forty minutes ago," the surveillance team responded. "Three occupants. No exit recorded."
Forty minutes. Enough time to sanitize records, relocate inventory, stage any number of surprises. Gile caught her partner's reflection in the rearview mirror—his jaw set, shoulders tight. He felt it too. The wrongness.
The radio crackled again. "High-value target may be present. Intel suggests key developer possibly on site."
Gile acknowledged without comment. Their briefing packet had been unusually specific about this operation: neural interface technology, consciousness-altering devices, potential mass production. Three governments wanted it stopped. The WHO had fast-tracked regulatory frameworks. Homeland Security had designated it an emerging threat.
All she had to do was execute the warrant.
The SUVs fanned out as they passed through the open gate, tires crunching on pristine asphalt. The facility looked newer than the satellite imagery suggested—fresh paint, manicured landscaping, security cameras that tracked their approach with professional precision. Not the appearance of an operation trying to hide.
Gile stepped out into morning chill that bit through her suit jacket. Dawn hadn't broken yet, leaving the complex in that gray space between night and day where everything felt slightly unreal. She drew the warrant from her breast pocket, its weight somehow heavier than the paper justified.
Other agents moved into position, spreading around the perimeter in practiced formation. Not guns-out—intelligence suggested no armed resistance—but her team knew better than to underestimate any situation. The Arizona chemical weapons bust two years ago had taught her that the most dangerous operations often looked the most routine.
At least they wouldn't need biohazard suits this time. Small mercies.
"Let's move," Gile ordered, her voice carrying the quiet authority of someone who'd done this a hundred times. "Stay sharp. Whatever they're manufacturing in there, we're here to make sure it stops."
She approached the entrance, aware of her team's footfalls behind her, the weight of the operation settling across her shoulders like familiar armor. The facility's glass doors reflected her approach—a federal agent at dawn, carrying a warrant, backed by institutional authority.
Everything by the book.
The doors opened before she could reach them.
A receptionist sat at the front desk, her eyes widening with what looked like genuine surprise but felt somehow rehearsed. The space beyond was too bright, too clean, fluorescent lights already burning at full intensity despite the early hour.
"Can I help you?" the receptionist stammered, hand trembling as she reached for her phone.
"Federal agents. We have a warrant to search these premises." Gile held up the papers without offering them, letting the official seal do its work. Her gaze swept the reception area, cataloging details: visitor logs on the desk, security camera with its red recording light active, doors leading deeper into the facility propped open as if expecting traffic.
As if expecting them.
"Just stay at your workstation and cooperate with the agents," Gile continued, her tone firm but not harsh. "They'll be collecting evidence. This will go easier if everyone remains calm."
Agents flowed past her, carrying evidence boxes, their movements efficient and professional. Gile signaled to her partner—take the offices—and moved toward the main facility entrance. The double doors stood open, light spilling from the factory floor beyond.
She paused at the threshold, a final moment before commitment. Somewhere in this building, if their intelligence was correct, was a technology three governments had deemed too dangerous to exist. Neural interface devices that could alter human consciousness permanently. Mass production capability that could scale from dozens to thousands to millions.
A threat that justified federal intervention at dawn.
Gile stepped through the doors onto the factory floor.
And stopped.
The space opened before her like a stage set—too perfect, too organized, too absolutely wrong. Row after row of assembly stations, each one producing brightly colored tablets with cartoon animals on the screens. Children's educational devices. Not neural interfaces. Not consciousness-altering technology. Just tablets.
For toddlers.
And in the center of the room, surrounded by a group of well-dressed adults, multiple cameras, and approximately a dozen children on what appeared to be a factory tour, stood Georgia Sato.
The CEO smiled at her with the calm of someone who'd been expecting company.
For fuck's sake.
Before Gile could key her radio, her partner's voice crackled through: "Boss, that box truck? It's a school bus. Yellow school bus with the words 'Future Innovators Field Trip' on the side."
The cameras swiveled toward her, red recording lights like accusatory eyes.
Gile felt the operation shift beneath her feet—from law enforcement to spectacle, from protection to performance. Every instinct screamed trap, but she was already inside it, already committed, already on camera with a dozen children staring at the federal agents who'd just stormed their field trip.
Georgia Sato's eyes met hers across the factory floor. No surprise in that gaze. No fear.
Just the patient satisfaction of someone who'd set a trap and watched it spring exactly as designed.
Gile descended the short flight of steps onto the factory floor, acutely aware that everything—every word, every gesture, every moment of federal authority—was being broadcast live to audiences she couldn't see.
"I am Agent Fiona Gile with Homeland Security," she announced, her voice steady despite the cold knowledge spreading through her chest. "We have a warrant to search these premises for illegal medical devices."
One of the suited men—a lawyer, had to be—stepped forward with the precise timing of choreography. "Agent Gile, I'm going to need you to explain to these children why federal officers are interrupting their educational tour of a licensed tablet manufacturing facility."
The children stared at her with wide, confused eyes. One little girl clutched her tablet demonstration unit tighter, as if the agent with a badge and gun might take it away.
Gile had executed dozens of warrants. Had faced down arms dealers, domestic terrorists, cartel operations. She'd been shot at, threatened, offered bribes that could have retired her twice over.
None of it had prepared her for being weaponized against children on live television.
"Please cooperate with the agents," she said, forcing her voice to stay professional, forcing herself not to look at the cameras. "This is a lawful search. We'll complete our work as quickly as possible."
But even as she spoke the words, even as her team spread out to conduct their search, Gile knew with absolute certainty they would find nothing.
This wasn't a manufacturing facility for banned technology.
It was a stage for making federal agents look like corporate thugs.
And she'd just delivered the performance exactly on cue.
