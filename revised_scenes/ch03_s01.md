Six months before the raid, Freeman "Bud" Turner, Director of Government Relations and Community Engagement, handed out another card. The new title resonated in his mind. Around him, friends and colleagues gathered at the end of the bar, exchanging laughter and clinking glasses.
Hull's bar teemed with energy, unusually busy for a Sunday. It was the type of place where professionals brought clients for dinner or stopped by for drinks after work, hoping to run into familiar faces in government, finance and industry. For Bud, Hull's wasn't just a favorite spot; it was where business truly got done. It made sense that he was here, celebrating his promotion.
Bud worked for one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies. With the promotion, he now oversaw how it engaged with local communities and governments, from neighborhood associations to Congress.
Years of navigating bureaucracies and administrations had equipped him well. With a master's in public affairs and a law degree under his belt, he knew his sharp mind and quick wit made him stand out. Most people seemed to genuinely like him. That last trait was especially useful. Bud's natural charisma and genuine interest in others made him persuasive in a way that seemed effortless.
"Congratulations, Director of Government Relations," Frank O'Hearn said, clinking his glass against Bud's with a knowing smile.
Bud's eyes narrowed. When a Board Chairman from a competing company sought him out at Hull's, it was rarely a coincidence.
"Thanks, Frank," Bud said, studying the older man's expression as he sipped his drink.
Frank's smile hardened at the edges. "Though I'm afraid your first challenge just landed on your desk."
Bud tilted his head, feeling a prickle of apprehension. Years in tech regulation had taught him to listen when someone like Frank spoke.
"The World Health Organization is pushing for neural interface regulations," Frank continued. "Some bureaucrats in Geneva convinced half the city that consciousness-altering technology needs oversight before it even exists." He let out a dry laugh. "I trust you'll help them see how… premature that would be, for the sake of both our companies?"
Bud's smile was automatic, though unease coiled inside him. The casual networking banter dropped. O'Hearn leaned in, and Bud recognized the look—this wasn't business positioning. This was conviction.
"I've reviewed the patent applications, Bud. Read the trial documentation." O'Hearn's voice lowered. "They're claiming permanent ego dissolution with a hundred percent success rate. Not temporary stress relief—complete transformation of consciousness."
Bud set his drink down carefully. "Isn't that the point of meditation technology?"
"Think it through." O'Hearn gestured toward the comfortable wealth surrounding them—Hull's Bar, the tech industry success, the infrastructure of modern prosperity. "What happens to economic systems when people stop wanting? When millions stop competing, stop consuming, stop striving? Our civilization isn't built on enlightenment—it's built on desire, ambition, the hunger for more. Remove that drive..."
He let the implication hang.
"All of this requires people who want it. Who'll work for it, invest in it, maintain it. Mass enlightenment doesn't disrupt markets. It ends them. And when markets collapse, everything else follows—supply chains, institutions, governance itself."
Bud felt the argument land in his gut. "But people have been meditating for thousands of years without civilization collapsing."
"Small numbers," O'Hearn countered. "Self-selected monastics who removed themselves from society. This is different—a technology that scales to millions, marketed to ordinary people who keep their jobs and families while their fundamental motivations rewire. It's not opting out. It's staying in while becoming incompatible with everything around them."
O'Hearn's eyes held his. "I've seen the modeling. There's a threshold—somewhere between thousands and hundreds of thousands of users—where the economic disruption cascades. One enlightened person stops buying things. A thousand enlightened people crash consumer sectors. A million? Systems fail before institutions can adapt."
The weight of it settled over Bud. He'd spent his career defending innovation, but this wasn't about stifling progress—it was about preventing systemic collapse.
"I trust you'll help them see that some technologies need to be contained," O'Hearn said, his voice gentler now. "Not because they don't work—but because they work too well. This isn't about protecting corporate interests, Bud. It's about protecting the foundations civilization depends on."
"Of course," Bud replied, and this time the words carried weight. He understood what he was agreeing to. The industry's worst fears often came before major leaps in innovation, but this felt different. Bigger. "Why the urgency for regulation?" he added, unable to ignore the feeling that he was missing a piece of the puzzle.
Frank's hand clapped down on Bud's shoulder, firm but brief. "Let's just say I've seen some interesting patent applications lately. We can't let bureaucrats strangle innovation in its cradle." With that, Frank melted back into the crowd.
Bud exhaled slowly, his mind already tracing the threads of influence he'd need to pull to kill regulations like these. But even as he mapped out phone calls and strategy, an itch of doubt lingered. Frank had painted a convincing picture of civilizational threat, but was it real? Or was it sophisticated rationalization for something else entirely?
Cheryl appeared at his side, glass raised. "To you," she said, eyes twinkling.
Bud's chest warmed at her presence, and he slipped an arm around her waist. "And to my wife," he added, raising his own glass, "who helped me reach where I am today and makes every success worth it."
The room hummed with laughter and cheer as Bud kissed Cheryl's temple. Her smile transported him to a place where the noise and the pressures melted away, leaving only the two of them in a perfect, unbroken moment. He whispered, "I love you," before they parted to continue mingling, the night unfolding in its usual whirl of conversation and clinks of glass.
