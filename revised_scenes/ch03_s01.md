Freeman "Bud" Turner, Director of Government Relations and Community Engagement. The new title resonated in his mind. He handed out another card. Around him, friends and colleagues gathered at the end of the bar, exchanging laughter and clinking glasses.
Hull's bar teemed with energy, unusually busy for a Sunday. It was the type of place where professionals brought clients for dinner or stopped by for drinks after work, hoping to run into familiar faces in government, finance and industry. For Bud, Hull's wasn't just a favorite spot; it was where business truly got done. It made sense that he was here, celebrating his promotion.
Bud worked for one of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies. With the promotion, he now oversaw how it engaged with local communities and governments, from neighborhood associations to Congress.
Years of navigating bureaucracies and administrations had equipped him well. With a master's in public affairs and a law degree under his belt, he knew his sharp mind and quick wit made him stand out. Most people seemed to genuinely like him. That last trait was especially useful. Bud's natural charisma and genuine interest in others made him persuasive in a way that seemed effortless.
"Congratulations, Director of Government Relations," Frank O'Hearn said, clinking his glass against Bud's with a knowing smile.
Bud's eyes narrowed. When a Board Chairman from a competing company sought him out at Hull's, it was rarely a coincidence.
"Thanks, Frank," Bud said, studying the older man's expression as he sipped his drink.
Frank's smile hardened at the edges. "Though I'm afraid your first challenge just landed on your desk."
Bud tilted his head, feeling a prickle of apprehension. Years in tech regulation had taught him to listen when someone like Frank spoke.
"The World Health Organization is sniffing around neural interface policy," Frank continued. "Early chatter out of Geneva—people who love frameworks more than facts—arguing that so-called consciousness tech needs oversight before it even exists."
The casual networking banter dropped. O'Hearn leaned in, and Bud recognized the look—this wasn't business positioning. This was conviction.
"I'm hearing early chatter, Bud—Geneva, a couple of think tanks, some jumpy boardrooms." O'Hearn's voice lowered. "People are tossing around big claims about 'consciousness tech' and behavioral shifts. Nothing verified—just enough smoke to get regulators sharpening their pencils."
Bud's throat tightened. "Isn't that the point of meditation technology?"
"Think it through." O'Hearn's intensity was unsettling. "What happens to economic systems if enough people change what they want? If they stop competing, stop consuming, stop striving? I'm not talking about a few Buddhist monks in the mountains—imagine something that actually scales."
O'Hearn gestured toward the celebration around them, the comfortable wealth, the technological infrastructure of modern life. "Civilizations are built on desire, Bud. On fear, ambition, the hunger for more. You remove that drive..." He let the implication hang. "All of this requires people who want it. People who'll work for it, invest in it, maintain it. If something actually shifted that at scale, markets would buckle. And when markets buckle, everything else follows—supply chains, institutions, governance itself."
Bud found himself leaning back. "But people have been meditating for thousands of years without civilization collapsing."
"Small numbers," O'Hearn countered. "Self-selected monastics who removed themselves from society. I'm talking about something that could reach ordinary people who keep their jobs and families while their fundamental motivations change. It's not opting out. It's staying in while becoming incompatible with everything around them."
O'Hearn's gaze locked on Bud's. "You hit a threshold and the disruption cascades. One person changes their demand profile—no big deal. Enough people do, and sectors wobble. Beyond that? Systems fail faster than institutions can adapt."
The argument landed in Bud's gut. He'd spent his career defending innovation, but this...
"I trust you'll help them see," O'Hearn continued, his voice gentler now, "that some technologies—if they work—need to be contained. Not because they don't work, but because they work too well. This isn't about protecting corporate interests, Bud. It's about protecting the foundations civilization depends on."
Bud's smile was automatic, though unease coiled deeper inside him now. "Of course," he replied, but this time the words carried weight he hadn't anticipated. He was agreeing to something larger than routine lobbying.
Frank's hand clapped down on Bud's shoulder, firm but brief. "Let's just say there's a lot of smoke right now—rumors, filings, breathless memos. We can't let bureaucrats strangle innovation in its cradle." With that, Frank melted back into the crowd.
Bud exhaled slowly, his mind already tracing the threads of influence he'd need to pull to kill regulations like these. But even as he mapped out phone calls and strategy, the doubt was sharper now. Why was Frank so invested? No—Bud understood exactly why. Frank had just told him: civilizational disruption. The industry's worst fears weren't about profits. They were about the world ending not with violence, but with a wave of inner change.
Cheryl appeared at his side, glass raised. "To you," she said, eyes twinkling.
Bud's chest warmed at her presence, and he slipped an arm around her waist. "And to my wife," he added, raising his own glass, "who helped me reach where I am today and makes every success worth it."
The room hummed with laughter and cheer as Bud kissed Cheryl's temple. Her smile transported him to a place where the noise and the pressures melted away, leaving only the two of them in a perfect, unbroken moment. He whispered, "I love you," before they parted to continue mingling, the night unfolding in its usual whirl of conversation and clinks of glass.
