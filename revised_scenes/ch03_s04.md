The next morning, Bud's unease grew as he approached the coffee shop where he'd agreed to meet Joe. The early chill bit at his neck, but he ignored it, quickening his step. His mind replayed the snippets of conversation from the night before, looking for what was gnawing at him.
Spotting Joe at their usual table, the farthest in the corner, Bud felt a flicker of relief. Joe raised two cups, signaling he'd already ordered for them.
"Joe," Bud called, stepping over the small fence to avoid walking through the crowded shop. "You've got my attention."
Joe placed Bud's coffee in front of him, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. "I figured."
Bud took a sip, savoring the rich, nutty flavor. The warmth slid to his core, a brief reprieve from the buzzing questions in his head. "So, what's this all about?" he asked, keeping his tone light.
Joe's grin was fleeting. "One of our mid-level execs was poking around, asking if any past projects were shelved because of platform bans."
Bud's brow furrowed. "Sounded official?"
Joe shook his head. "If it were, we'd hear from HR or Legal first. This feltâ€¦ different."
"Were there any?" Bud asked, leaning in.
"I don't know," Joe admitted, finishing his coffee. "But the way he asked, like he knew something. And then there's the chatter about neural interfacing."
"Chatter?" Bud's pulse quickened.
Joe's eyes darkened, a rare seriousness replacing his usual levity. "This executive is an AI expert, Bud. If he's concerned, we should be too. Could the WHO really ban a program outright?"
Bud's mouth set in a firm line. "They could try. We'd fight it, of course." He gave a tight smile, but his mind raced. "This suit got a name?"
Joe hesitated before leaning in. "Zach Goodman."
