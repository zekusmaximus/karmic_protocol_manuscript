The hum of servers from the next room seemed to pulse with his racing thoughts. Tim pressed his thumb against his deceased brother's meditation beads, the familiar grain of wood anchoring him as Zach's footsteps approached again, sharp against the floor.
"She's still stable?" Zach's voice searched for something measurable. Tim heard the edge of fear beneath the technical question.
"She's awake," Tim corrected, not turning to look at him.
Carly moved into the room, her administrative confidence faltering. "The first successful trial," she said, clutching her notepad like a shield. "We need guidelines, protocols for…"
"Protocols?" Tim interjected, a sharp laugh that escaped him. "We've turned consciousness itself into code, and you want a policy manual?"
"The brain scans are clear," Zach pressed on, his voice tight with nervous energy. He moved to Tim's right, tablet in hand. "Neural plasticity off the charts, default mode network showing unprecedented restructuring. The quantum processors maintained coherence through the entire sequence—we're talking sustained entanglement states that shouldn't be possible with biological systems. The AI's learning curve adapted to her neural patterns in real-time, refining the guidance algorithms on the fly."
"Look at her," Tim cut in. Zach stiffened beside him. "Really look. Do you need a scan to tell you what's happened? She is a completely enlightened being. A Buddha."
Sherry sat unmoving, but her presence filled the room like light filling a dark space. Even the air seemed to breathe differently around her.
"We need to document everything," Carly said, but her voice had lost its administrative edge. "The next participant…"
"Will be here tomorrow," Tim finished. "And the next soon after. And the next…" The words trailed off, a weight settling over the room.
Zach's sharp intake of breath carried all his terror of uncontrolled variables. "Tim, we can't just…"
"Can't just what?" Tim turned to face him. "Can't just let people wake up? Can't just show them what's real?" His voice cracked on the last word. "Tell me, how many more Michaels do we need before it's worth the risk?"
Sherry's voice, when it came, cut through the tension like a knife through fog. "The dharma will find its way." Six simple words, but they carried the weight of certainty.
Zach and Carly exchanged glances. Tim watched them process what they were seeing—the protocol was working. That was the miracle and the terror of it. Everything they'd theorized, everything they'd coded and tested and feared, was sitting before them in human form.
"The retreat center can't handle this," Zach muttered, his hand running through his hair. "One success we could contain, but if we run more trials…"
"Trials?" The edge was apparent in Tim's voice. "Is that what we're calling it now? Clinical trials for the end of suffering?" His brother's beads clicked softly between his fingers, a sound that used to bring comfort but now felt like a countdown.
"Two more candidates are ready," Carly said.
"My brother Michael would have been first in line," Tim said softly, the words seeming to escape before he could catch them. "He would have…" But he couldn't finish.
"He would have understood," Zach filled the silence, his voice gentler than Tim had ever heard it. "The risks, the potential consequences, he would have said they were worth it."
"Would he? Or am I just telling myself that to justify what we're about to do?" Tim looked up, meeting their eyes one by one. "Because let's be clear, we're not just running more 'trials.' We're about to break open the world."
"The quantum processors are stable," Zach said, falling back on technical certainty. "The neural interface is cleaner than anything we've seen. The AI pathways are refining with each iteration—the system's already learning faster than we designed it to. We could scale this to thousands of users within months."
"Where in the code," Tim cut in, his voice rising, "did we account for this?" He gestured toward Sherry. "Is there a function for dissolving everything a person thinks they are?"
Sherry sat in stillness, aware of the gulf between what they were discussing and what she had experienced—between the thought of who one was and the dissolution of that self.
Tim's brother's beads clicked softly as he stood. "I need to check on the figures, then help Zach with the final calibrations for tomorrow."
Carly nodded quietly as she and Zach walked out, leaving Tim alone with Sherry and the weight of what they'd created.
