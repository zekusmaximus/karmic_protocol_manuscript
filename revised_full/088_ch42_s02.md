Cray stepped down from the witness table, his footsteps measured despite the heat rising in his chest. He slid into a seat near the back of the chamber, his eyes scanning the room. The faint shuffle of papers and hushed conversations filled the pause before the next speaker was called. He tapped at the screen of his tablet, pulling up the intelligence reports he couldn’t stop thinking about. 

His hand hovered over the screen as the session resumed. Another speaker, a digital ministry director from First Life Church, took the stand. Cray tuned out the opening pleasantries, his focus divided between the unfolding hearing and the implications on his screen. The clock was ticking faster than he had anticipated. 

Cray looked up just as the speaker launched into a fiery critique of the protocol, describing it as “a tool for dismantling divine order.” The words barely registered. His gaze lingered on the senators’ faces, noting who nodded along and who shifted uncomfortably in their seats. The hearing wasn’t over, but his strategy was already moving beyond it. 

Sliding his tablet shut, Cray leaned back in his chair, his face impassive. Let them argue theology and philosophy. He would sway them here, but the real battle was taking place far beyond these walls, and Cray intended to win it.
