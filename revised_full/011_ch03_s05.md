That night, Bud leaned back into the patio chair and looked out at the stars over his backyard. The cool air carried the scent of freshly cut grass, mingled with the rich aroma of his cigar. The fall evening was crisp, perfect. He let the silence settle over him, a brief respite from the buzzing questions in his mind. Cheryl sat nearby, curled up with her glass of wine. She glanced at him, her eyes softening as they met his.
"Penny for your thoughts?" she asked, her voice breaking the quiet.
Bud chuckled, turning to face her. "They don't come that cheap," he teased, with a laugh that sounded less heavy than he anticipated.
"Inflation," she joked, shifting to face him more fully, the glass resting against her lips before she took a small sip.
Bud's smile lingered as he looked at her, but the weight of the day pressed back into his chest. "I was just thinking about how lucky I am, this house, this life, you."
Cheryl's eyes narrowed playfully. "You work hard for all this," she said, tilting her head. "But you're still thinking about something else."
Bud exhaled, conceding with a nod. "I was wondering, what if the legislature tried to ban the new AI virtual reality platform?"
Her brow furrowed as she set her glass down. "You'd be able to stop them, wouldn't you?"
A flicker of doubt crossed his mind, but he pushed it aside. "Of course. But what if I couldn't? What if it went further, making it illegal to even own a headset?"
Cheryl's lips parted as she considered the question. "They could stop imports, halt sales. But why would they?" She watched him closely, curiosity mixed with concern.
"I don't know," Bud said. "It seems far-fetched, but with neural interfaces, anything feels possible."
She leaned closer, her eyes steady and confident. "If anyone could stop the government from doing something that drastic, it's you," she said, her voice unwavering.
A soft smile pulled at his lips as he met her gaze. "Yeah," he murmured, letting the tension ease slightly. He looked back out at the stars, the endless sky seeming to stretch out with possibilities he couldn't quite grasp. He pushed the thoughts aside, leaning over to kiss her, the warmth of her touch grounding him. "I guess you're right."
"Of course I am," Cheryl said, a playful smile lighting her face. "I'm your wife. Now, how about some neural interfacing of our own, Mr. Director?"
