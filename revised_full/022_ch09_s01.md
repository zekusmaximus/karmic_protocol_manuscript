Finn shrugged, a gesture that tightened the knot in Zach’s chest. Frustration bubbled just beneath his composed exterior. “Well, all five headsets were here last time we did inventory,” he said, his voice edged with tension as he pointed to the drawer, now holding only four headsets. 

“It must be around here somewhere,” Finn muttered, adjusting his worn baseball cap while his eyes roved the basement room with quick, darting glances. 

Zach watched him and felt the pulse in his temples throb. 

After a tense silence, Finn continued, leaning over to peer into a half-empty drawer. “Which one is missing?” Finn continued, leaning over to peer into the half-empty drawer. 

“Number five, the last one we made,” Zach replied, trying to keep the urgency out of his voice. He scanned the room again, knowing full well he had already checked every corner. We can’t afford something like this to happen, he thought, jaw tightening. “Sarah was the last one through the protocol, which headset did she use?” 

“Three, I think.” Finn said, crossing the room and starting to rummage through a box at the far end. “Maybe it got mixed in with these,” he suggested, his voice muffled as he sifted through the pile of spare parts. Zach narrowed his eyes, watching the haphazard way Finn searched. 

“That’s the parts box, Finn,” he said, striding over, trying to control the impatience creeping into his tone. 

“Yeah, but some of these parts are full headsets,” Finn shot back, turning one over and squinting at its markings.  

Zach reached into the box, lifting another headset, and inspecting it. Each passing second gnawed at his focus as Finn moved to open more drawers and cabinets. This room was supposed to be secure, their designated testing space. Headsets only left to run the protocol in the meditation cells upstairs, no exceptions. They would need gps tags and security cameras. 

Finn let out a frustrated huff as he shut a drawer with more force than necessary and signed in to the visitor logging terminal. “Almost no one’s been down here since the last inventory,” he said, showing the screen to Zach, brows furrowed. 

Zach looked at the list, his eyes skimming the familiar names but finding no answers. Whoever it was had to know what they were looking for. 

“Without the software, there’s nothing anyone could do with it, right?” Finn asked, his voice breaking the silence, though there was an edge of doubt in it. 

Zach clenched his jaw, feeling the pressure in his chest intensify. “Well, maybe that’s beside the point,” he said, handing the sheet back to Finn. “Tim updated all of them. Even if someone tried to load the AI without decrypting it, it wouldn’t work.” 

“Here it is!” Finn’s sudden exclamation broke the tension, and Zach’s head snapped up, pulse quickening. Carly stepped into the room at that exact moment, her eyes catching Zach’s before darting to Finn. 

“Here’s what?” Carly asked, her voice calm but curious as Zach pushed the sign-in sheet back into Finn’s hands and moved quickly to inspect the headset. 

Relief flooded him as he recognized the number five etched by the earpiece. The tightness in his chest eased, and he took a slow, steady breath. Crisis averted, this time. 

“Zach thought we’d lost one of the headsets,” Finn said, a trace of humor in his voice as he logged out of the visitor terminal and headed for the door. “Should I sign in since I was here helping you look for it?” 

Zach managed a wry smile, the tension giving way to a weary amusement. “Very funny, Finn.” He placed the number five headset carefully back into its proper drawer, feeling the weight shift off his shoulders, even if just for a moment. Finn left, his muttering voice fading down the hall, leaving Carly and Zach alone in the quiet room. 

He glanced at her, catching a flicker of concern in her eyes. “One wasn’t put back, and I panicked,” he said, the admission coming out as a half-apology. 

“Fair enough,” Carly replied, taking a seat at one of the desks. She shifted, crossing her legs, her tone changing to something more serious. “You do know that at some point we’re not going to be able to control when and how these are used.” 

Zach’s mouth set in a thin line. The thought had gnawed at him for weeks, a persistent undercurrent to every task. “Indulge me until then, please,” he said, the words feeling heavier than he intended. 

“The story got posted this morning,” Carly said after a pause, reaching into her pocket and holding her phone up as if to show him. He glanced at the screen, then looked away, not needing the visual to stir the unease already churning in his stomach. 

“How bad is it?” His voice was quieter now, the fight momentarily gone. 

“Oddly enough, it isn’t bad at all,” Carly said, turning the phone back toward herself and scrolling. “Modern meditators have had a breakthrough in their quest for enlightenment with the help of virtual reality,” she read aloud. 

Zach exhaled a long, weary sigh, rubbing the back of his neck. “Did they use your quote?” The tension trickled back, a small rivulet working its way into his thoughts. 

“An abbreviated version,” Carly said, a light laugh slipping through as if to reassured him. “No real information on how it works or what it really does.” 

“No hint about the original source?” He lifted his gaze, trying to find a thread of hope in her expression. 

Carly shook her head and slipped her phone back into her pocket. “I’m not sure it matters now,” she said, her voice resigned, but her eyes held a guarded alertness. 

The article had been posted on The Modern Meditator website, nestled in their technology section. Zach’s considered potential sources then thought better of it. Too many loose ends, he thought, a familiar frustration gnawing at him. 

“We need to regroup and talk strategy for publicity,” Zach said, moving toward the door, his steps brisk, fueled by a simmering determination. Just as he reached the threshold, another thought halted him. He turned, locking eyes with Carly. “Should we consider putting everything on hold until we know more?” 

Zach noticed her quick calculation, weighing the consequences. The center had been cautious so far, but even patience had its limits. 

“I was thinking the opposite,” Carly said at last, and for a moment, the certainty in her voice made him pause. 

His brow furrowed, confusion and curiosity mingling. Before he could respond, she pressed on. 

“The protocol has been working beyond our wildest dreams. One hundred percent success rate. Everyone’s meditation practice has been elevated because of it,” she said, her conviction building. 

Zach’s fingers curled into a fist at his side. Success at what cost? The question burned in him, but he stayed silent. “Yet the arahants keep leaving, going to the hermitage at Jeta’s Grove, disappearing into the wilderness, who knows where.” The term “arahants” had become commonplace, first suggested by Tim as a nod to the Buddhist idea of those who had gained true insight. Zach had resisted the term initially, finding it archaic, but the word had settled into their vocabulary as if it belonged. 

He thought of Sherry, the first arahant, who had slipped away one night, leaving behind nothing but questions. She hadn’t been heard from since. 

“All living in peace, free from the bondage of suffering, many dedicated to helping others on the path,” Carly countered, her voice softening but unwavering. “That remains the goal, right?” 

Zach’s gaze dropped for a moment as he considered her words. The room felt smaller, like it was closing in on him. It is the goal, he reminded himself, but that didn’t make the unknowns any easier to bear.
