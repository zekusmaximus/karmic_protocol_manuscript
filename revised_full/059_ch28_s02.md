Suddenly, another pair of sandals came into view. She lifted her gaze and saw Ed approaching, hands clasped in front of him, moving steadily from the other direction. 

Ed brought his hands together and offered Carly a small bow. She mirrored the gesture, feeling a fleeting twinge of envy at his glowing smile, his calm demeanor and the kindness radiating from his eyes. 

The envy dissolved as quickly as it appeared. It was nearly impossible to hold on to anything other than joy in the presence of one of the awakened ones. The tension in her face eased, and the corners of her lips turned upward into a soft smile. 

“Ed,” she said, acknowledging him. 

“Carly,” he responded, stepping to the side. For a moment, she thought he was making way for her to pass, but as she moved forward, he turned slightly, signaling his intent to walk beside her. 

“What thoughts today?” he asked, his voice calm and searching as he looked at her with a knowing expression. 

“I just noticed the path has been cleared of leaves,” she replied, her tone light. 

“Sweeping the path is a relaxing, meditative task,” Ed remarked, his eyes briefly drifting to the ground ahead. 

“Allegorical as well,” Carly added, a hint of reflection in her voice. 

“How so?” Ed asked, tilting his head slightly to catch her response. 

“Oh, you know, keeping the path clear for those who follow,” Carly said, her voice trailing off as the thought settled into the space between them. 

“Yes,” Ed replied, a knowing look crossing his face. “I believe I do know. You’ve done much the same over the years, keeping the center running.” 

A wry smile tugged at her lips. “Well, that’s all over now,” she said, waving her hand as if sweeping away the remnants of the past. 

“Perhaps.” 

They walked in companionable silence, the sound of leaves rustling underfoot punctuating their thoughts. After a while, Carly paused and turned to face him. “Why did you decide to stay here and teach? Some of the others…” She hesitated, unsure how to frame her question without revealing too much of her doubt. 

Ed seemed to sense her discomfort and interrupted gently, “To the path clear.” 

The tension eased in her shoulders, and she met his eyes with a small, grateful smile. “I’m afraid I may have missed my chance at enlightenment,” she admitted, a note of regret threading through her voice. “Do you think we handled the protocol skillfully?” 

Ed’s expression turned contemplative. “We were presented with an unprecedented situation. We were as mindful and kind as was possible under the circumstances. Despite the setbacks, the wheel has been set into motion, and even without the protocol, the path has been cleared.” 

“Until the next storm,” Carly said, resuming their walk. The thought she had been turning over since the raid edged forward, seeking release. She stopped, glancing sideways at Ed. “When Homeland Security came here… I heard from Tim that the agents never saw you or the others. Is that true?” 

Ed’s smile deepened, the corners of his eyes crinkling. “The agents saw what they were capable of seeing. Like the merchants of old who passed by the Buddha under his tree, seeing only another wandering ascetic.” His gaze followed a single leaf spiraling down from above, landing softly at their feet. “The protocol doesn’t grant powers or create miracles, Carly. It helps remove the veils that prevent us from seeing what has always been true.” 

Carly nodded slowly, the idea settling into her thoughts. “Until our own veils are lifted, we see only what we expect to see,” she said, the realization warming her from the inside out. They continued walking, silence stretching between them, as the wind picked up and leaves scattered across the path once more. 

When they reached the main house, Ed stopped and turned to her, taking her hands in his. “Carly,” he said, his voice carrying a quiet strength, “though neither hope nor regret will benefit us, these feelings are as natural as the winds. Keep your path clear, recognize suffering as suffering, and continue your practice. I teach because, even though it may appear that modern society is overcome with passion, clinging, and aversion, if you look closely, you’ll see the seed of enlightenment inside even those most shrouded in darkness and submerged in sorrow.” 

A subtle shift moved through Carly as she glanced past Ed, noticing several people in the distance, busy with their daily routines. For the first time, she felt as though she could truly see them. Each one seemed to carry a seed, some glowing faintly, ready to sprout, others shadowed but still alive and waiting. She turned back to speak, but Ed had already moved on, walking toward the others with a calm, purposeful stride.
