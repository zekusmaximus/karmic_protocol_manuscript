Bud Turner scanned the virtual boardroom, noting the last couple of avatars materializing into their seats at the table. Each avatar was an impressively accurate replica of the real person, with a name and position displayed in bright lettering above. His gaze drifted to the large screen at the end of the table, a tool that any participant could use to present information to the group. 

The room’s design was meant to simulate a typical boardroom: a polished hardwood table at its center, plants lined neatly along one wall, and a long window with its shade drawn down on the opposite side. Bud’s attention caught on the virtual door in one corner, designed to mimic real-life interruptions with a knock if someone tried to join after the meeting began. 

In front of him, a virtual notepad sat waiting, paired with a pen ready for scribbling. He flexed his fingers, knowing he could pull up a private computer screen with a gesture if needed. The room’s features were meticulously crafted, participants could mute their voices or movements, and a dark shroud would descend over their avatars should they need to temporarily exit the virtual setting. Bud appreciated the thoroughness of the design; it mirrored the real-life subtleties of human interaction while adding a layer of control. 

The attendees were a testament to Bud’s influence and the tech industry’s reach. He recognized Constance Henning, his friend, and a trusted ally, already seated. Nearby, Lawrence Cray, Under Secretary of Science and Technology from Homeland Security, leaned forward, tapping a finger on his virtual notepad. Next to Cray sat Gwen Trout, the no-nonsense Director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA. The Senior Counsel for Privacy and Security Enforcement at the FTC was present too, their avatar projecting the sharp intensity Bud had come to expect. Each high-ranking official was accompanied by a senior staff member. 

Bud’s eyes shifted to Frank O’Hearn, the only other industry representative in the room. Frank had pushed relentlessly for this gathering, insisting Bud and Constance organize it. Constance’s attendance at the virtual reality conference, where the karmic protocol had first been demonstrated, had made the persuasion easy. Bud knew she had immediately grasped the potential, and the risks, of the protocol’s broader implementation. Now, their task was to convey this urgency to the rest of the group and guide them toward crafting a proactive response plan. 

“Thank you all for logging in and thank you to Bud Turner for allowing us to use the Virtual BoardRoom for this meeting,” Constance began, her tone authoritative but appreciative. Bud felt a faint wave of pride at her acknowledgment. “I assume you all received the briefing file I circulated, which included the video and transcript of Tim Mulvaney’s presentation at the recent Virtual Reality Conference about the so-called karmic protocol.” 

Bud’s eyes flicked around the room, observing the subtle nods from the other avatars as they confirmed receipt of the materials. Constance continued without missing a beat. “Under Secretary Cray was the first person I contacted regarding this, and our preliminary investigations suggest that Mr. Mulvaney’s claims about the protocol are accurate.” 

Cray leaned forward slightly, his avatar’s movements stiff and mechanical. “Indeed,” he said, his voice steady. “We’ve confirmed Mulvaney’s assertion that the retreat center, known as Jeta’s Grove in upstate Vermont, has functioning prototypes, and preliminary reports indicate that dozens, possibly more, individuals have already undergone the protocol.” Bud noted the slight strain in Cray’s voice, a signal of the weight of what Homeland Security had uncovered. He knew Cray’s team had been compiling detailed narratives and dossiers, framing the participants as ‘victims,’ a term that hung heavily in the room, highlighting the stakes at hand. 

“Let me formally introduce Bud Turner and Frank O’Hearn from the industry,” Constance said, gesturing toward their avatars. Bud resisted the urge to shift uncomfortably. The spotlight always brought an anticipatory tension. “They have been instrumental in helping us understand the scale and implications of this issue.” 

“Thanks, Commissioner,” Frank interjected, his tone crisp and direct. “Bud and I have been reviewing Mulvaney’s claims with our engineering and programming teams. We’ve reached a few conclusions that we believe warrant immediate attention from the administration.” Bud’s ears perked up at Frank’s choice of words. “Actionable intelligence,” Frank continued, and Bud mentally repeated the phrase, feeling the subtle irony of it. Frank’s voice was smooth, but Bud knew his colleague’s disdain for bureaucracy all too well. 

Director Trout’s avatar shifted as she spoke. “We conducted a comprehensive search through our records, and there is no application on file for a device or outcome of this nature,” she stated, her tone clipped and matter of fact. Bud saw a brief, almost imperceptible frown cross her face before she continued. “Given the information we have, it’s clear that such a device should have followed our medical device licensing tracks before human trials began.” 

Frank nodded slightly, continued, “Second, we need to address the use of the retinal scan, electroencephalogram and biofeedback components. These pose significant mental health risks, like identity distress and surveillance anxiety, not to mention critical data privacy concerns.” 

Bud’s gaze settled on the FTC attorney as they spoke. “We, too, have checked,” they said, their voice cool and deliberate. “Although we can’t be sure they are collecting any data, if they are there’s no record of collection or usage of this nature filed with the FTC.” Bud felt the room’s tension ripple, a palpable undercurrent that solidified the gravity of their conversation. He clenched his jaw, recognizing that this was just the beginning of what would undoubtedly be a drawn-out battle for control and accountability. 

Frank nodded at the acknowledgment and pressed on. “As an aside, we believe that the technology in this device may have been improperly obtained from my own company, possibly through an executive who is also a board member at the retreat center.” 

He paused, fingers drumming against his virtual desk. “We’re examining our civil options, including a broader look at all companies potentially involved in this technology’s development. Several of these entities share… concerning overlaps in ownership and control.” His gaze flickered briefly to Bud. “But for now, knowing this probably stems from theft of hardware and intellectual property should add weight to the administration’s case for action.” 

Bud noticed Frank tapping his fingers on the desk, a habitual gesture that felt oddly muted in the silent virtual environment. He watched Frank take a deep breath before continuing. “Finally, and this is perhaps the most troubling, is that all of this is being controlled not by psychologists or medical professionals, but by a closed-source artificial intelligence. While not technically illegal, the AI is alarming. My company uses algorithmic tech in many products, but this isn’t about tracking consumer habits for targeted ads, this is… well, something else entirely.” 

Frank’s pause hung in the air, and Bud could sense the ripple of unease that passed through the room. “I think I’ve covered the most significant and actionable points,” Frank added. “But I also want to highlight a few broader implications. Exposing people to this type of radical shift in perception, what essentially amounts to Buddhist enlightenment, could undermine faith in organized religion, destabilize economic participation, and erode the fabric of our democracy. People will become homeless and stop contributing.” 

Bud’s eyebrows shot up at the dramatic statement. He couldn’t help but think Frank was exaggerating, but he noted the sober expressions around the room. Maybe this level of emphasis was exactly what they needed to drive home the urgency. 

“So where do we start?” someone asked, the realization of the potential scale dawning visibly in his tone. “Can the FDA issue a cease-and-desist, or do we need to pursue relief through the Justice Department for Mr. O’Hearn’s claim of theft?” 

Constance’s avatar leaned forward, taking charge. “I’d like us to explore all those avenues and brainstorm any other potential approaches while we’re gathered here. It seems we’re on the same page about needing to put a halt on this technology before more harm is done.” 

Lawrence Cray, who had been silent, spoke up. “We’re already three-quarters into fiscal year 2027,” he pointed out, his avatar’s posture shifting forward. “Any large-scale on the books operation will require budget reallocation or a supplemental funding request.” 

Constance’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully. “The timing could work in our favor. Congress is finalizing the FY2028 appropriations. If we act fast, we can incorporate this into the next cycle.” 

“Hopefully before they ramp up to mass production and deployment,” Bud said, gesturing toward the large screen as he activated a video clip. Tim Mulvaney’s image appeared, speaking passionately at the conference. 

“By enlightenment, I don’t mean mindfulness, or anxiety reduction, or lowering your blood pressure, although all that comes with it. I mean full and complete spiritual enlightenment, being completely awake to reality as it is, like the Buddha…”
