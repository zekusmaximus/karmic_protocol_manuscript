After a brief drive, Sherry sat quietly in the corner of the Homeland Security office, the room’s sterile light casting cold reflections on the desks and filing cabinets. She had expected the questioning to be tense for the agents, but instead, Agent Fiona Gile had been surprisingly affable, her voice steady and probing but never harsh. Her partner hadn’t masked his frustration as well. However, each question Fiona posed carried a hidden edge, as though she was carving through Sherry’s responses for a hidden truth. 

The questioning had ended, but Sherry remained, waiting to be dismissed, or given further instructions. Across the room, she could hear the agents talking. One typed on his computer, the rhythmic tapping somehow comforting in the silence. Fiona scrolled through her phone, muttering to herself. 

“How does someone agree to be a guinea pig for an untested, radical, mind-bending thing like this without knowing how it works?” Fiona’s voice cut through the room, loaded with incredulity. 

Sherry’s gaze dropped to the floor, taking in the scuff marks on her shoes as the partner’s response came with a half-hearted chuckle. “Never experimented with LSD?” The room’s atmosphere stiffened as Fiona didn’t laugh. The agent cleared his throat. “She was clear there was no coercion.” 

The phone rang, and Fiona’s hand shot out to grab it. “Agent Fiona Gile,” she said, the professionalism in her voice unwavering. Sherry glanced up, watching Fiona’s brow furrow as she listened. From the tone, Sherry guessed it was someone senior, likely the boss. 

“No, sir, we completed our interview. We are about to release her,” Fiona said, her voice carefully neutral. A pause, followed by a slight tightening of her jaw. “She was cooperative. We have names, dates, everything she could give us.” 

Sherry caught the subtle shift in the partner’s posture; he leaned back in his chair, arms folded, his eyes flicking toward her. He seemed thoughtful, as though reviewing their conversation in his mind. 

“She isn’t going anywhere, sir,” Fiona continued, glancing at Sherry for a brief moment. “She appears to volunteer at the same soup kitchen regularly. If we need to follow up…” 

A harsh voice crackled through the receiver, too low for Sherry to catch the words, but the tone spoke volumes. Fiona’s shoulders tensed, and she looked over at her partner with a slight frown. 

“Yes, sir,” Fiona said finally, her voice clipped. “Understood.” 

The room seemed to breathe out as Fiona hung up. For a moment, silence stretched thin. Sherry could feel the undercurrent of tension settling between the agents. 

Fiona turned to the other agent, a resigned look in her eyes. “The boss wants us to keep her,” she said, her voice low. “With or without her consent.” 

The agent’s brow furrowed as he shifted in his chair, glancing at Sherry with a look she felt almost bordered on an apology. “Oh, I’m sure she’ll stay willingly,” he said, but there was an unspoken question in his tone: But why? The discomfort on his face mirrored the strange unease settling in Sherry’s chest. 

“We’ll get the briefing tonight,” Fiona said, raising her hands in a gesture of frustration before turning back to her notes. Her partner did what he always did, turned his attention to other things. 

“Well will you look at this?” Sherry heard the agent remark after a brief silence. “Advent Industries announces major market move with strategic investment initiative.” 

“Isn’t that O’Hearn’s company?” Fiona replied, betraying surprise. Sherry paid closer attention. 

“That wasn’t lost on me.” Her partner quipped, tossing the newspaper over the desk to Fiona. “First an all-points bulletin to find the Sato facility, now O’Hearn is positioning himself for something bigger.” 

“Looks like Georgia Sato is getting hit from all sides.” Fiona said, looking over the article herself. “Coordinated pressure. Ever feel like a corporate pawn partner?” 

Sherry sat still, absorbing every detail.
