Fiona Gile sat in Christine Torres’ office, tension simmering beneath her composed exterior. The silence between them stretched thin, taut with the anticipation of the agent’s unspoken questions. Torres hadn’t flinched when she arrived. She’d simply motioned her to the chair across from her desk and continued reading her documents, as if a federal agent dropping by unannounced was an everyday occurrence. 

“Ms. Torres,” Gile said, breaking the silence. “We need to locate Georgia Sato.” 

She watched Torres’ reaction closely. Her eyes lifted, calm and detached. “And you think I can help with that?” 

Gile leaned forward, her tone firm. “You represented Zach Goodman. Sato hired you. Given recent developments, we have reason to believe…” 

“That I’m somehow tracking the movements of a former client’s associate?” Torres set her pen down with a deliberate click. Her voice was sharp. “Or are you hoping I’ll breach attorney-client privilege?” 

“We’re trying to prevent further manufacture of these devices,” Gile said, noticing the slight hesitation in her own voice. The conviction that usually underscored her words was absent, replaced by something more uncertain. 

“Are you?” Torres’ eyes narrowed, the veneer of professionalism slipping just enough to reveal an edge of personal concern. “My sister went through the protocol six months ago.” 

A chill swept through Gile. This was not the turn she’d expected. 

“She was a corporate litigator,” Torres continued, her voice tightening with emotion. “Eighty-hour weeks, two divorces, addiction issues she managed to conceal well enough to keep her partnership. The kind of person you’d assume would abandon everything after enlightenment, wouldn’t you?” 

Gile cleared his throat. “Did she abandon everything?” 

Torres’ expression softened, a faint, almost wistful smile appearing. “She still practices law. Still puts in the same grueling hours. But now? Her clients actually listen to her. She helps them see solutions they were too blinded by fear and greed to notice before. Her billable hours are down, but her success rate is off the charts.” 

Gile’s stomach tightened. This was not what Cray would want to hear. “That’s… interesting,” she said, choosing her words carefully. 

Gile let the silence sit for a moment before pushing herself to her feet, needing to end the conversation. “But not relevant to my investigation. Thank you for your time, Ms. Torres.”
