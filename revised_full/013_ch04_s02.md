Later that evening, as the moonlight wavered over the pond, Ed sat alone, cross-legged on the soft earth near the meditation hall, the faint hum of cicadas weaving through the stillness. His hands rested loosely on his knees, palms open, his breath shallow and quiet. He didn’t need to close his eyes; to him the world was already luminous. 

The gravel path leading to Jeta’s Grove glimmered faintly in his mind. He felt its every stone, the air shifting softly over its curves. Somewhere in the distance, a deer paused mid-step, its heartbeat a soft rhythm that blended with his own. The protocol hadn’t erased his senses; it had made them boundless. Everything touched him, not as noise or distraction but as melody. 

The fish are just an excuse. He remembered the words from an elder meditator during his first day at the retreat center. The man had smiled when he asked why so many seemed simply to sit by the water. They’re not looking for answers, only reflections. 

Now he understood. The protocol had been a mirror, not a revelation. It had shown him the layers of himself he once mistook for walls. Thoughts came and went like ripples on the pond’s surface, barely noticed, until they vanished entirely. What remained was something simpler, something vast: the endless stillness beneath the surface. 

His first hours after awakening had been marked by an almost overwhelming clarity, each sensation sharp and profound. Yet, as the days passed, he found himself drawn to silence, not for what it lacked but for what it contained. He spent long hours listening to the way the wind carried voices and to the pause between the questions people didn’t know they were asking. 

Ed’s gaze drifted to his reflection in the water, the faint curve of her face visible among the stars scattered across its surface. His image shimmered as the wind shifted. There was no need to steady it. The distortion was no less real than the stillness. 

For years, he had chased moments like this, believing enlightenment would feel like a victory, an achievement. Like finishing that marathon in his forties where he’d collapsed at the finish line, gasping but triumphant—the same way he’d pushed through corporate mergers and retirement planning. But there was no finish line here, no medal to hang on the wall. The protocol hadn’t transformed him into something new; it had simply removed the fog he’d been lost in his entire life.. Stepping through had been inevitable, like finally seeing that the door to the room he’d been frantically searching for had been open the whole time. He smiled from the quiet contentment of knowing he had been here all along, wondering how many others would soon discover their own open doors, and what that might mean for a world built on the very fog he’d left behind. 

The moon rose higher, its light bending over the pond and the woods beyond. Ed stood slowly, brushing the dust from his hands. He began walking toward the hall, his movements soft but certain. Each step felt both deliberate and incidental, part of a rhythm he neither created nor resisted. 

Behind him, the pond stilled again, reflecting the sky with perfect clarity.
