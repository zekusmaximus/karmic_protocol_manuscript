The SUV merged into midday traffic, carrying them away from Georgia Sato's perfectly staged disaster and toward the bureaucratic machinery that would grind this morning into acceptable narrative.
Gile's hands hadn't stopped shaking since they'd left the factory. She pressed them flat against her thighs, willing the tremor to stop, aware that her partner was pretending not to notice. Twenty years of federal enforcement—chemical weapons busts, cartel operations, domestic terror cells—and she'd never felt her hands shake.
But she'd never been weaponized before. Never been the instrument of someone else's corporate warfare while believing she was protecting national security.
"Say it," she told her partner, her voice harder than intended.
He glanced at her, then back to his phone. "Say what?"
"That we fucked up. That we got played. That every instinct I had walking into that facility was right and I ignored it anyway because the intelligence said—" She stopped, the words catching in her throat. Because the intelligence said. As if intelligence materialized from nowhere, as if it had no source, no agenda, no architects engineering precisely this outcome.
"This had to be a setup," her partner said quietly, giving her what she'd asked for. "The lawyers showed up too fast. Not just any lawyers—I counted seven different firms. Corporate defense, antitrust, securities litigation, media rights, civil liberties advocacy." He scrolled through his phone. "That's not a scrambled response to unexpected raid. That's a coordinated deployment."
Gile closed her eyes, seeing it again: Georgia Sato's perfect positioning, cameras already broadcasting, children arriving exactly forty minutes before federal agents, the receptionist's rehearsed surprise, the factory floor lit for optimal video documentation.
Someone had prepared that facility for inspection. Not to hide evidence—to showcase its absence.
"Market alerts came through during the breach," her partner continued. "Advent Industries filed acquisition notices on three Sato subsidiary companies. The timing..." He pulled up timestamps, turned the screen toward her. "They moved the exact minute we entered the building. While we were searching for Protocol hardware, O'Hearn was stripping Sato's corporate assets."
The pieces assembled themselves with sickening clarity. Frank O'Hearn—corporate raider with a reputation for hostile takeovers and strategic asset stripping. The name had appeared in briefings as peripheral context, a businessman concerned about regulatory compliance, a corporate voice advocating for government oversight of dangerous technology.
Not as someone orchestrating federal law enforcement to provide cover for corporate warfare.
"We're not just law enforcement," Gile said, her voice flat with recognition. "We're corporate raiders. O'Hearn used our investigation as a weapon, and we handed it to him gift-wrapped with federal authority."
Her partner's expression confirmed he'd reached the same conclusion. "Above our pay grade," he said carefully, the phrase carrying weight they both understood—not dismissal but acknowledgment that what they'd stumbled into was larger and more dangerous than their positions could safely address.
"Is it?" Gile opened her eyes, rage crystallizing into something cold and methodical. "Is it above our pay grade when we're the ones who executed the operation? When our names are on the warrant? When those cameras broadcast federal agents terrorizing children?"
She pulled out her phone, opened a new document, began typing with deliberate precision.
DHS Raid - Sato Manufacturing Facility - Operational After-Action Report (Preliminary)
Date: [Today's date]
Lead Agent: Fiona Gile
Classification: Internal Review
Summary of Operations:
Federal warrant executed 5:47 AM at suspected Protocol manufacturing site. Facility discovered to be legitimate tablet production for educational distribution. No banned devices found. No Protocol hardware detected. Children's tour in progress at time of entry—
"What are you doing?" her partner asked.
"Documenting." Gile kept typing. "Every detail. Exactly what we found and exactly what we didn't. The timing of O'Hearn's market moves. The impossible coordination of legal defense. The prepared nature of the site. The fact that intelligence leading to this operation originated from—"
Her phone buzzed. CRAY displayed on the screen.
Gile stared at it. The phone buzzed again, insistent.
"You going to answer that?" her partner asked.
She should. Cray was her superior, the operation's architect, the one who'd shown them classified assessments and modeling data about consciousness-altering technology that could destabilize social systems. Who'd been so convinced of the threat that he'd never questioned where the intelligence originated or whose interests it served.
The phone buzzed a third time.
Gile answered. "Agent Gile."
"Where are you?" Cray's voice carried the edge of someone who'd already heard preliminary reports and didn't like them.
"En route to headquarters. ETA fifteen minutes."
"Make it ten. We need to debrief this disaster before the media narrative solidifies any further." A pause. "I've been fielding calls from three different congressional offices and two separate legal teams. Tell me you at least found something we can use."
Gile watched the city slide past the SUV's windows—morning traffic, people living ordinary lives, unaware that federal agents had just been deployed as corporate mercenaries. "We found a legitimate manufacturing facility producing educational tablets for children. Clean inventory, proper licensing, nothing remotely resembling Protocol hardware."
Silence on the line. Then: "The intelligence was specific."
"The intelligence was wrong."
"Or they sanitized before we arrived. The box truck—"
"Was a school bus, sir. Carrying children for a factory tour that had been scheduled for weeks. The entire operation was documented, livestreamed, perfectly staged to make us look like jackbooted thugs invading a charity operation."
Another pause. Gile could hear Cray processing, recalibrating. "Sato knew we were coming."
"Yes sir. She knew, and she prepared. Not to hide evidence—to showcase federal overreach on live television with a dozen children as witnesses."
"How?" The question cracked through the line. "Operational security was airtight. Unless—" He stopped.
Gile filled the silence he'd left. "Unless someone wanted her to know. Unless someone provided intelligence specifically designed to trigger a raid that would fail spectacularly and provide cover for parallel action."
"That's a serious accusation, Agent Gile."
"It's a serious situation, sir. Advent Industries filed acquisition notices during our raid. The timing was precise—they moved the moment we entered the facility. O'Hearn's been positioning himself to strip Sato's assets, and we just gave him the crisis he needed to justify a hostile takeover."
She heard Cray's breathing change, the slight hitch that meant he was doing calculations, tracing implications, recognizing patterns he'd been too focused on the Protocol threat to notice before.
"O'Hearn's corporate movements are not DHS concern," Cray said finally. "Our mandate is national security, not market regulation."
"Our mandate is protection, sir. And this morning we protected corporate interests while calling it law enforcement."
"Careful, Agent Gile." The warning carried weight—not threat exactly, but acknowledgment that she was approaching lines that couldn't be uncrossed once articulated. "We executed a lawful warrant based on credible intelligence about a genuine threat. The fact that the operation didn't yield the evidence we expected doesn't mean—"
"Where did the intelligence come from?"
The question hung between them like a blade.
Cray's silence stretched long enough that Gile knew she'd struck target. When he spoke again, his voice had changed—less superior officer, more someone recognizing they might both be standing on ground that was less solid than they'd believed.
"That's not—"
"Not my concern? Not my pay grade? Not questions I should be asking?" Gile watched headquarters loom ahead, the building where she'd reported for duty for eight years, where she'd believed in institutional authority and the badge's meaning. "Because it feels like exactly my concern when I'm the one whose name is on the warrant that just became national news for all the wrong reasons."
The SUV pulled into the underground garage. Gile's partner killed the engine, sat motionless, clearly hearing her half of this conversation and understanding its implications.
"Ten minutes," Cray said. "Conference room C. We'll discuss this in person."
"Yes sir. But I'm bringing my preliminary after-action report. The one that documents everything—including questions about intelligence sourcing."
"Agent Gile—"
"We're supposed to protect people, sir. That's what the badge means. And this morning I helped execute a corporate hit while federal agents scared children on live television. So yes, I have questions. And yes, I'm going to document them. That's my job."
She heard Cray's sharp intake of breath. When he spoke, his voice carried something she'd never heard from him before—not anger, not threat, but something closer to recognition. Maybe even respect.
"Conference room C. Ten minutes. Come ready to explain exactly what went wrong out there."
"I will, sir. Will you be ready to explain where our intelligence originated and why nobody questioned it?"
The line went dead.
Gile sat in the SUV's sudden silence, her hands finally steady, the tremor replaced by something colder and more dangerous—clarity.
Her partner cleared his throat. "That was..."
"Career-limiting?" Gile opened her door, stepped out into the garage's fluorescent light. "Probably. But I've spent twenty years believing the badge meant something. If I'm wrong about that—if we're just instruments for whoever feeds us intelligence and tells us it's protecting national security—then the career isn't worth protecting."
She started toward the elevator, her partner falling into step beside her.
"For what it's worth," he said quietly, "I'll back your report. Everything you documented—I saw it too."
Gile nodded, grateful but not surprised. They'd worked together long enough that she'd known he would. The elevator doors opened. They stepped inside.
"You think Cray's involved?" her partner asked as the doors closed. "Think he knew we were being used?"
Gile pressed the button for their floor. "I think he was so convinced the Protocol was an existential threat that he didn't question anything that helped him contain it. O'Hearn saw that conviction and weaponized it."
"And now?"
"Now we find out if our institutions can handle the truth about how they're being manipulated, or if we're already too compromised to care."
The elevator climbed toward the conference room where Cray was waiting, where she would deliver a report that might end her career but would at least preserve her understanding of what the badge was supposed to mean.
Twenty years of federal enforcement.
Twenty years of believing institutional authority served justice.
Twenty years that had led to this moment—standing in an elevator, carrying documentation of her own weaponization, about to confront her superior officer with questions he might not be able to answer.
The elevator chimed. The doors opened.
"Ready?" her partner asked.
Gile stepped forward into the hallway, toward conference room C, toward Cray and whatever consequences this conversation would carry.
"I'd better be," she said. "Because ready or not, we're about to find out exactly how deep this goes."
