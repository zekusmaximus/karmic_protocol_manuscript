Zach watched Bud step down from the podium, a wave of polite applause following him as legislators and industry leaders leaned in to offer handshakes. Bud’s speech had hit all the familiar beats. References to history’s turning points like electricity and the internet, balanced notes on innovation versus oversight, even that worn anecdote about the man with the red flag leading electric cars, which Zach had heard a dozen times but still drew a smattering of chuckles. 

Zach’s eyes caught the reaction of the senators, their nods approving of Bud’s words about driving development underground through excessive regulation. The tension in Zach’s chest tightened. He had seen those looks before. They weren’t just about concern or genuine policy alignment, they hinted at something more calculating, something tied to revenue and control. 

As Bud made his way back to his seat, Zach noticed Frank O’Hearn in the front row, giving a slight, approving nod. It seemed to affirm that Bud’s role as the opening act had done exactly what it was supposed to, set the agenda without ruffling feathers. Zach tried to absorb the shift in the room, the subtle current of purpose that pulsed beneath the surface of every handshake and glance. 

A disquiet stirred in Zach, a remnant from his last conversation with his co-worker Joe about platform bans and the whispers of scandal surrounding VR churches. It appeared as if they were all perched on the cusp of something greater, a reality no one dared to acknowledge. The technology was evolving at breakneck speed. What if they were already too late to shape it? He pushed down the unease as the first panel began to assemble on stage. It wasn’t his job to fixate on unknowns, not yet at least. 

July heat clung to Zach as he wiped a trace of sweat from his forehead and made his way to the podium that afternoon and gave his prepared remarks. 

“In conclusion, while minimal and sensible regulation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality can help foster a competitive environment, overreaching or innovation-discouraging regulation will only kill progress in the field.” 

The applause was polite but muted, a professional reflex rather than genuine enthusiasm. Zach’s gut tightened with the familiar sting of a lukewarm reception. As he stepped off the stage, his eyes met Bud’s, who was waiting in the wings with a practiced smile. 

“Great job, great job,” Bud said, extending a firm handshake before pivoting back to the audience. Zach watched as Bud strode onto the stage to announce a break before dinner, seamlessly transitioning the energy in the room. 

Zach doubted Bud’s praise. Maybe passable, he thought, but certainly not great. The hallway felt cooler as he stepped away from the crowd, heading toward the conference room reserved for speakers. The tension in his shoulders eased with every step; at least it was over. His speech had been a product of the legal department’s pen more than his own, tailored precisely to Bud’s expectations. He could have done better if given more freedom. But it was done, and that counted for something. 

“Mr. Goodman!” 

The voice came from behind him, and he turned to see a young woman weaving through the thinning crowd to catch up. 

“Hello,” he said, offering a polite smile as she reached him. 

“Hi,” she replied, slightly breathless as she slowed to a stop. “Great talk, you managed to make a very boring subject interesting.” 

“Thanks,” Zach said, a wry smile breaking through. “Not sure if I changed any minds, but I tried.” He extended his hand automatically. 

“Oh, sorry,” she said, a faint blush coloring her cheeks as she took his hand. “I’m Jessica Everett. I work in policy for the state senate.” 

He nodded, a flicker of interest sparking. “So, one of the people I was hoping to reach with that speech?” 

“I suppose so. I just started in this position and am already learning a lot,” she said, fumbling in her handbag before pulling out a card and handing it to him. 

Zach glanced at the card, Jessica Everett, Policy Analyst, State Senate.  

“I wanted to say hello because I love virtual reality,” Jessica said. “It must be fascinating creating content for it. Your bio mentioned you were in programming before becoming a project director?” 

“You read the bios?” Zach raised an eyebrow, surprised. Nobody read the bios. 

“I read everything. Are you staying for tomorrow’s program? I’d love to grab a coffee and pick your brain on some stuff.” 

“Uh, yes, I am,” Zach replied, still adjusting to the sudden turn in the conversation. “I have a friend presenting at one of the morning sessions. I’ll be at lunch; can we talk then?” 

“Perfect. Well, I won’t keep you any longer. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Goodman,” she said, turning and walking away. 

Zach felt a small smile on his lips. “You can call me Zach,” he called after her, the formality of “Mr. Goodman” making him feel ancient. 

She glanced back with a bright smile. “Great, Zach. See you tomorrow.”
