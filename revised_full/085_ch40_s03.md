The winter wind bit into Tim’s thin jacket, a sharp reminder of the two months that had slipped away since his detention began in December 2027. He started walking, letting his feet guide him in the direction of his apartment. When he was confident no one was tailing him, he stopped in a shadowed alley and opened the envelope again. 

The slip of paper held a handwritten message: “Conditions are subject to ceaseless change, strive onwards with care.” 

A phrase attributed to the Buddha, and one that seemed to settle into him like a final, silent instruction.
