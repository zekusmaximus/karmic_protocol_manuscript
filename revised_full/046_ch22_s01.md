“We could force our enemies to go through this protocol after they are defeated so that they remain peaceful and docile for the remainder of their lives under our rule,” Constance Henning said, her tone exaggerated. Fiona Gile sat across the room, her attention flicking to Under Secretary Cray. She knew he’d been steering every meeting about the protocol with increasing intensity since the first raid. Constance’s quip was meant to knock him off balance. 

Cray’s eyebrows lifted, as if weighing the outlandish suggestion. Gile caught the flicker in his eyes, a calculation. He was already thinking ahead, probably about stricter controls or legislation. She shared his frustration at the slow-moving bureaucracy but doubted anything would change until the situation grew worse. 

“If we force this on people, we’re just as bad as Goodman and his cronies,” another official cut in, their voice edged with righteousness. The likely made up rumor that the retreat center had coerced participants into using the protocol clung stubbornly to every conversation, despite Gile’s own understanding that the evidence said otherwise. 

“Obviously, I was joking,” Constance shot back, the irony in her voice sharp. “Weaponization, or any use at all of this thing is in contradiction to the administration’s direct orders.” 

“So far,” Cray muttered. Gile could sense the tension between them and knew this verbal sparring was more than just a power play, it was a battle over how far they were willing to go. 

“Really, Larry?” Constance’s tone dripped with condescension, the use of his first name intentional. Gile watched Cray’s jaw tighten. He was not one to be taken down a notch easily. 

“Madame Commissioner,” Cray replied, voice precise, “The prototypes, codes, programs and notes are all impounded. By you. At your facility. Let’s stay focused on the operation against this potential manufacturing site of Ms. Sato’s, which, as you know, is a priority for the administration. We still have no clue where it is.” His words were clipped, but he was right. Gile had seen the dossiers and knew they had little room for error. 

Constance’s mouth twitched, and Gile sensed the weight of her frustration. Bud Turner’s involvement had been the catalyst for this entire operation spiraling out of control. Now, every government branch, private entity, and even some religious factions were circling like vultures, each with their own agenda. The room felt charged, the air thick with tension and a slew of baseless theories: rogue AI, societal pacification, the fall of major institutions. 

Clearing her throat, Gile leaned forward. “If I may, Madame Commissioner,” she said, conscious of every eye turning to her. The nod from Constance was permission enough. Gile spoke confidently, outlining the operation she’d meticulously planned. 

“We believe this is where Mulvaney and Sato have begun mass production of the protocol virtual reality hardware,” she said, the steady rhythm of her voice anchoring the room as she pointed to a map. “We need to be fast, covert, and thorough. Our goal is to take the protocol off the streets for good before it has the chance to spread.” 

She paused, scanning the faces around the table, gauging their reactions. The stakes were high, and Gile knew that at this moment, precision and resolve were their only allies.
