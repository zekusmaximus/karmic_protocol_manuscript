Eight months before the raid, the woman who would destroy civilization as we knew it sat cross-legged in a basement meditation cell, tears streaming down her face beneath a sleek black virtual reality headset.
The hum of the device resonated through Sherry's temples, sending waves of warmth throughout her body. Patterns of light bloomed behind her closed eyes, emerging not as mere visuals but as if they were born from deep within her. Bright flares pulsed, commanding her attention, while softer, more fleeting shapes lingered at the edges, like whispers caught on a breeze. Each light, each pulse, resonated with a strange familiarity, weaving through her mind like a forgotten song.
Her breathing slowed, syncing with the pulse that throbbed at the base of her skull. Memories floated past her awareness like leaves on a still stream: the crisp scent of winter mornings, her father's aftershave, the comforting weight of her camera in Yosemite. But unlike before, when she might have clutched at these fragments, she watched them dissolve without resistance. The constant chatter of her mind softened, leaving a profound stillness that was almost tactile.
Tears flowed like morning dew, a natural condensation of something that had always been there, waiting to be recognized and released. The cushion beneath her legs pressed into her skin, a weave of textures that grounded her in this space. The cool air brushed against her damp cheeks, anchoring her as the boundaries between herself and the room shifted, becoming porous.
A shift occurred within her then, as if she had woken up from a sleep she couldn't remember falling into. The distinct tone she knew indicated the completion of the protocol echoed through the room.
Muffled voices from outside the meditation cell filtered in, sharp and strained. Tim's voice, so familiar, carried an urgency she hadn't often heard. Moments later, he appeared in the doorway, his eyes wide and shadowed with worry. He stepped into the room, the tension radiating from him like heat.
"How do you feel?" he asked, crouching down, his voice low but edged with anticipation. His fingers played absently with the loop of meditation beads around his wrist.
Sherry let the question settle into the silence before responding. "I feel awake," she replied, each word imbued with a truth that resonated in her chest.
Relief flashed across Tim's face, softening his features for an instant. He glanced over his shoulder, where footsteps echoed in the corridor.
"Meeting in the hall," he called to the figures waiting outside.
Sherry watched as Zach Goodman strode past, his brow furrowed, tension visible in the tightness of his jaw. Carly Rice followed, clutching her notepad so tightly her knuckles whitened. The energy of their anxiety buzzed at the edge of Sherry's awareness, sharp and electric, like a storm building on the horizon.
They moved down the hall and around a corner, but she could still make out their voices through the low hum of the servers filling the next room, mingling with the sound of her breath. Her fingers brushed the rough fabric of the cushion, grounding her as the ripples of their departure settled. She sensed the gravity of their meeting, the way their hurried steps and clipped voices had disturbed the room's stillness.
Time seemed to expand, punctuated only by the rhythmic thrum of the servers in the next room. Dust motes drifted through the thin beam of light filtering from the small, barred window, a reminder of the world beyond unchanged, yet irrevocably altered.
"We need guidelines for containment." She could hear Zach, a distinct worry in his voice. "One success of this algorithm to enlightenment is remarkable. But two? Three? Someone's going to notice."
"We're not stopping," she heard Tim quickly cut in.
"He's not saying stop." Now it was Carly, bringing her familiar calming tone. "He's saying we need to be smarter. More careful. The moment this gets out…"
"Fine," Tim said. "Start on it and let me get back to Sherry."
When Tim returned, the weight of the meeting was etched into the lines of his face. He moved with deliberate steps, settling across from her. His eyes, still searching, met hers with a mix of awe and fear.
"We've turned the wheel of dharma," he said, voice trembling with reverence and doubt. "This changes everything."
Sherry regarded him, the flicker of fear beneath his excitement even clearer to her now. A wave of compassion swelled in her chest. He was still seeking, grasping for the security of answers. But she no longer needed that certainty. There was only the awareness, vast and serene.
"I am struck by your extraordinary radiance and peaceful presence," Tim said—practiced words she realized—a quote. The hint of a smile crept across his face, breaking through his tension.
The words touched her, but they passed through her awareness like a ripple on a pond. "It is no different, yet completely different," she said after a moment. "I see the same objects, the same colors, even seem to have the same thoughts, like recognizing your quote."
Tim's expression shifted, a glimmer of understanding dawning.
Sherry's gaze swept the room, taking in the familiar shapes that now seemed charged with new clarity. "Yet there is an immediacy, a vividness, a clarity… not in the things themselves, but in my perception of them."
For a moment, Tim's eyes reflected the enormity of what this meant, the millions of lives that could be touched and changed. The responsibility loomed, and she saw the tremor of doubt return.
"Everything changes, Tim," she whispered, the words an echo of truth. "The goal is to awaken to that truth."
He nodded, the tension in his posture easing as understanding settled over him. She was referring to the concept of impermanence. "The protocol will need looking after," he said, almost as if to himself. "To continue, to develop, to share…"
