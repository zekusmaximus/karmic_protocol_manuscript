“They’re still searching the old facility,” Tim said, walking up with his tablet displaying security feeds. “Third sweep this week. O’Hearn’s people are going crazy trying to figure out where the production materials he was convinced existed went.” He smiled slightly. “The district manager I left behind is getting quite irritated with all the corporate auditors disrupting his legitimate electronics business.” 

Zach nodded, remembering their last night at the facility. “How’s the shareholder transition going?” 

“Georgia’s playing her part perfectly,” Tim replied. “Appearing appropriately defeated in board meetings, gracefully accepting O’Hearn’s ‘strategic vision’ for her companies. Meanwhile…” he gestured to the busy room around them, where people continued the real work of their mission. 

A new alert caught Zach’s eye, “Advent Industries Stock Drops as Acquisition Reveals No Significant IP Assets.” 

“They thought they were buying the protocol,” Zach mused, watching another set of units undergo final testing. “Instead, they got a perfectly ordinary electronics company with surprisingly well-documented accounting.” 

“Georgia’s final gift to them,” Tim said with a hint of satisfaction. “Everything legitimate, everything ordinary, everything exactly where it should be. Just not what they were looking for.” 

The room hummed with focused energy as they continued their work. Each unit verified represented another small victory - not just over corporate control, but over the very idea that consciousness could be owned, regulated, or contained. 

Zach’s shoulders slumped as he gazed at the operation, his ragged breaths slowly. While O’Hearn’s corporate machine churned through paperwork and property transfers, the real transformation was already beginning, spreading person to person, beyond the reach of shareholders or regulators. 

But that was secondary now. The civil lawsuit continued to drag on, an ordeal that could stretch for months. Without the key evidence, however, it felt like only a matter of time before that case, too, would be dismissed. 

Zach was keenly aware that he was still unemployed, but the sheer magnitude of the current mission left little room for concern. This was real work, meaningful work, manufacturing and distributing the karmic protocol. It consumed every spare moment, and he felt a flicker of satisfaction in that.
