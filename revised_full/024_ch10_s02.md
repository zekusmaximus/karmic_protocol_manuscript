At home later that night Bud rubbed his eyes, feeling the strain as he leaned into the worn leather of his chair. Printouts of news articles and regulatory briefings lay scattered across his desk, illuminated by the cold blue light of his computer screen. The room was dark, the shadows stretching like specters around him as he pushed to finish his opening remarks for the conference. 

A headline on the screen snagged his attention: “Gaming Giant Shutters Mental Health Division Amid Regulatory Concerns.” Below it, another headline read, “VR Meditation App Raises Privacy Red Flags.” He’d been collecting articles like these for weeks, each one a piece in the narrative he was shaping, a case for balanced oversight over knee-jerk regulation. Public sentiment swayed wildly between tech optimism and fear-driven panic, leaving no stable middle ground. 

His phone buzzed, and the name on the screen made him sigh. Frank O’Hearn. Of course, Frank would still be up at this hour. 

“Evening, Frank,” Bud answered, forcing energy into his voice. 

“How’s the speech coming?” Frank’s tone was sharp, impatient. 

“Almost there,” Bud said, flipping through a stack of notes. “I’m trying to strike the right tone. Thinking of starting with some historical context, the days when computers filled entire rooms, the early days of the internet. Show that we’ve faced this before.” 

“Good, good,” Frank said after a pause. “But remember why we’re doing this conference, Bud. We need these legislators to see what’s at risk. Every added compliance demand, every new regulation, they’re antithetical to innovation.” 

Bud stood and moved to the window, staring out at the glittering city below. “I know, Frank. But we can’t completely ignore their worries. Some of these uses, mental health, altered states of consciousness…” 

“That’s exactly the mindset that’ll sink us,” Frank interrupted, his voice cutting like a knife. “The minute we treat every new technology like a threat, we hand the industry to our competitors overseas. Do you think they’re wringing their hands over this in Shanghai?” 

“No, but…” 

“But nothing. Look, you’re good at this, Bud. You know how to make them feel heard while steering them where we need them to go. That’s why you’re up there and not me.” Frank’s laugh came through the line, brittle and humorless. “I’d just tell them to get the hell out of our way.” 

A small smile tugged at Bud’s lips. Frank’s bluntness was oddly reassuring, even if it would be disastrous in the current climate. “Don’t worry. I’ll thread the needle.” 

“You better. Word is the Commerce Committee is already drafting new oversight frameworks for neural interfaces. Neural interfaces! Most of that tech is still theoretical, and they’re already looking to regulate it.” 

Bud’s eyes narrowed as he leaned over his desk, clicking through the files on his computer screen. “Which is exactly why this conference matters,” he said. “Get them in the room, show them the real applications, the jobs being created, the problems being solved. Make it concrete.” 

“Just don’t let them drag the panels down with questions about worst-case scenarios and hypothetical risks. Keep it focused on the now, on what’s working.” 

Bud’s gaze fell to his notepad, where he’d scrawled a line during one of his brainstorming sessions: Better to have these technologies developed in the open than in shadows. “Understood. Though I still think we need to acknowledge…” 

“Did you see the news about First Life Church?” Frank cut in. “Their whole virtual congregation program is imploding. That’s the kind of PR nightmare we don’t need right now.” 

Bud’s expression hardened. “David Charles,” he muttered. The headline and details flashed through his mind. “Didn’t you know him from the country club?” 

“Never trusted him. Using VR for religion was asking for trouble.” Frank’s tone sharpened, each word brimming with disapproval. “But mark my words, they’ll use this as ammunition to justify clamping down on the entire industry.” 

“All the more reason to get ahead of it,” Bud replied, his fingers drumming lightly on the desk. “Show them we’re responsible actors, that we take legitimate concerns seriously.” 

“Just don’t lean too far into the conciliatory tone. We need their focus on opportunity, not fear.” Frank’s sigh crackled through the line, weary but resigned. “I know you’ll get it right, Bud. That’s why we chose you for this. Just… keep the big picture in mind.” 

The call ended, leaving Bud staring at the draft of his speech glowing on the monitor. Frank’s words echoed in his mind: opportunity, not fear. He knew the stakes were high, but Frank’s all-or-nothing approach didn’t sit well with him. Technology as potent as this needed guardrails, didn’t it? The key was finding a balance that protected innovation without stifling it. 

Bud’s hands hovered over the keyboard before he started typing, each keystroke a deliberate attempt to strike that balance. He needed to craft a message that bridged the chasm between Silicon Valley’s “move fast and break things” mindset and Washington’s penchant for preemptive regulation. There had to be middle ground, a way to… 

“You’re still at it?” 

The unexpected voice pulled Bud from his thoughts. He looked up to see Cheryl standing in the doorway, holding two cups of coffee. The house had been so quiet that he’d almost forgotten he was working from his home office. 

“Lost track of time,” he said, taking one of the cups with a grateful nod. “The conference is day after tomorrow.” 

“And you’ll be brilliant, as always.” Cheryl perched on the edge of his desk, eyes skimming over his notes. “Though I’m not sure caffeine at this hour is the best idea. Mine at least is decaf.” 

“Says the woman enabling me,” Bud said with a half-smile. He took a sip of the coffee, feeling the tension in his shoulders ease slightly. “Sorry I’m not better company tonight.” 

“Please. I knew exactly what I was getting into when I married DC’s favorite tech whisperer.” Cheryl’s smile was warm as she touched his hand. “Just don’t stay up too late. Walking into a room full of politicians running on no sleep is never a good idea.” 

“Almost done,” he said, trying to sound reassured. “Just need to fine-tune the opening a bit.” 

She leaned over, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Don’t let Frank push you too hard. He forgets sometimes that not everyone shares his… intensity.” 

As she left the room, the door clicked shut behind her. He exhaled slowly, his shoulders dropping an inch as the air seemed to expand around him. The space felt different now—quieter, yet somehow more breathable. She was right about Frank, always relentless. But she was also right about him being the right person for this job. Bud knew how to talk to both sides, finding that delicate balance where common ground could be forged, even when it seemed impossible. 

He turned back to his screen, eyes scanning the list of conference attendees: politicians, regulators, industry leaders, all converging in one place to shape the future of technology. Most of them had only a surface understanding of its true potential. His gaze caught on a name: Tim Mulvaney, slated to speak on meditation applications. A flicker of recognition stirred in Bud’s mind, Carly Rice’s choice to attend. The dots began to connect. Zach, Frank, neural networks, AI enlightenment. This Tim character might be bringing something significant to the table now that the retreat center was experimenting with that new AI-driven headset. 

The warmth of the coffee seeped through him, as his fingers resumed typing. Outside the window, the city lights glimmered like stars scattered across the dark canvas of night. In the stillness of his home office, Bud Turner crafted his speech, words chosen with precision for a future that was hurtling toward them all, faster than most of them realized.
