A bit further into the grove, one of the newly awakened sat quietly beneath a tree as the pair passed. 

He watched their forms disappear into the darkness, the rhythm of their footsteps absorbed by the night. The surrounding stillness was vast, not an absence but a fullness, as if the air itself was alive with meaning. He could feel the tension clinging faintly to Carly’s movements, her worry a shadow that lingered even in her retreat. Sherry’s calm was steady, a light that didn’t waver, but it wasn’t hers alone. It belonged to the grove, the trees, the stars and the deep silence that bound it all together. 

He lowered his gaze to the earth beneath him, the rough bark of the tree pressing gently against his back. The cool grass between his fingers felt impossibly intricate, each blade distinct yet inseparable from the whole. This was the gift of the protocol, not revelation, but the dissolving of boundaries. The world no longer appeared in fragments. It was complete, unified, present. 

And yet, he could still feel the ripple of unease from those who had come to the grove earlier that day. Their laughter, their questions, their searching, all of it lingered in the fabric of the place. It wasn’t a distraction. It was simply another thread in the endless pattern, no more or less important than the stars overhead or the insects humming softly in the distance. 

He thought of the man who had sat across from him at dinner, his hands fidgeting restlessly with the edge of his napkin. “How do you know?” the man had asked, his voice low, as though the question itself was a risk. “How do you know when it’s real?”

At the time, he hadn’t answered, not because he didn’t want to, but because there was no answer to give. How could he explain that the search itself was the barrier? That what they sought was already within them, waiting in the stillness they feared to face?

Now, in the quiet of the grove, the memory of the question didn’t stir frustration or pity, only understanding. He could see the man’s struggle as clearly as his own reflection on the surface of a pond, distorted but unmistakably real. The anxiety they carried wasn’t separate from his calm; it was part of the same current, flowing toward the same vast ocean.

He exhaled softly, his breath merging with the cool night air. Enlightenment wasn’t an escape. It wasn’t an answer. It was this: the steady pulse of the world, unbroken and complete. It was the recognition that nothing needed fixing, that even the sharp edges of longing and fear were part of the wholeness.

Above him, the canopy shifted gently, the leaves murmuring in the wind. He leaned back against the tree, his body and the earth beneath him indistinguishable for a moment. Tomorrow would come, as it always did. For now, there was only this boundless and infinite space, as it had always been.
