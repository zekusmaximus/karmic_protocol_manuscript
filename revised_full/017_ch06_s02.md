In the basement of the retreat center, the low hum of computers pressed into the silence. Zach’s eyes strained as they moved over the lines of code on the protocol’s latest iteration, a familiar anticipation in his chest. Across the room, Tim stood by the window, staring into the night as though searching for answers in the darkness. The unspoken tension between them buzzed like static, sharp and charged. They both knew this confrontation had been coming for days. 

“I don’t think you get it, Zach,” Tim said at last, breaking the silence. His voice was calm, but frustration sharpened its edges. “You’re so caught up in the mechanics and the code that you’re missing the point. This isn’t just some new technology, this is the future of human consciousness. Do you even understand what we’ve created?” 

Zach’s fingers hesitated over the keyboard, but he kept his gaze fixed on the screen, forcing himself to stay composed. “Of course, I understand,” he muttered, the words tasting bitter. “Well, most of it, maybe not some of Sarah’s code.” He chuckled then got serious again. “I did help build it Tim. But that’s why I’m worried. You talk as if a few enlightened beings are going to save the world.” 

Tim’s brow furrowed, his silhouette rigid against the dim glow of the computer monitors. The tension between them thickened as Tim turned, his voice rising with urgency. “This tool can break the cycle of suffering, just as the Buddha taught. And you want to hesitate?” 

Zach stood abruptly, the chair scraping against the floor, the sound slicing through the room like a reprimand. He forced himself to meet Tim’s gaze, heat flaring in his chest. “What I want,” he said, each word deliberate, “is to be sure we’re not rushing headfirst into disaster. You’re obsessed with ‘turning the wheel of dharma,’ but what about the consequences for society? When society breaks down, or alleviating the suffering of some only makes I grow tenfold for others? What happens then?” 

A flash of anger crossed Tim’s eyes, disbelief trailing behind it. “You’re afraid,” he said, the words cutting into the space between them. “Afraid to see that the world is suffering, and we have the power to change that. Hate, war, jealousy, it’s all based on people suffering, and the protocol can end that. Don’t you see what’s at stake here?” 

Zach felt his jaw tighten, the muscles straining with the effort to keep his voice controlled. “I do see what’s at stake, Tim. That’s exactly the problem. You’re so focused on saving people from suffering that you’re blind to the greater risks. What if the protocol creates more suffering? What if it fractures society while freeing individuals?” 

Tim moved closer, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “This is bigger than either of us, Zach. You know that. We’ve tapped into something… extraordinary. Don’t tell me you can’t feel it.” 

Zach’s gaze dropped to the floor, his hands curling into fists as the familiar shiver of unease traveled through him. “I feel it,” he admitted, the confession scraping against his throat. “That’s what disturbs me.” 

The room fell silent, the soft hum of the machines enveloping them once more. For a moment, the only sound was the rhythmic ticking of a nearby wall clock, its mechanical heartbeat underscoring their impasse. Then, Tim exhaled, the tension in his stance ebbing slightly. “We can’t afford to be scared now. Not when we’re this close.” 

Zach’s shoulders slumped, the fire in his chest flickering as doubt seeped in. “And what if we’re not close enough?” 

Tim didn’t answer, only looked at him with eyes that held both challenge and expectation. The room seemed to hold its breath, waiting for Zach to make the choice. Waiting for him to believe. 

Just then, the fear that had gripped Zach for months, the fear of unleashing something uncontrollable, gave way to another realization. 

If anyone could make sure the protocol worked as intended, it was him. He glanced over at the shelf where the prototype headsets sat, neatly arranged, each one representing years of research and countless sleepless nights. Sherry’s words came back to him: “The dharma will find its way.” But the dharma didn’t write code. It didn’t debug neural feedback loops or calibrate quantum sensors. That was his job. 

Tim’s footsteps echoed faintly as he paced toward a window,. Zach turned to him, his decision made. 

“You’re right,” Zach finally said, his voice breaking the silence. 

Tim stopped, turning to face him. 

“You’re right about the protocol,” Zach continued, standing now, his hands braced against the desk. “It’s the future. And I’ve been holding back, not because I don’t believe in it, but because I’m scared of what happens if we screw this up.” 

Tim’s expression softened, a flicker of hope flashing in his eyes. 

“But here’s the thing,” Zach said, his voice firm now. “If anyone’s going to make sure we don’t screw it up, it’s me. I know the code, the hardware, the risks. I know how to make this work the way it’s supposed to. If I walk away, someone else might rush it, might miss something crucial.” 

Tim nodded slowly, understanding dawning on his face. 

“So,” Zach said, straightening. “I’m in on moving quicker. Completely, no pauses. But on one condition.” 

Tim raised an eyebrow. “What condition?” 

“We do it right,” Zach said. “No shortcuts. No rushing at the expense of getting it right. Every headset, every calibration, we double-check everything. We don’t just push this out because we’re excited or desperate. We owe it to everyone who’ll use this to get it right.” 

Tim’s lips curled into a small, relieved smile. “Agreed,” he said, holding out his hand. 

Zach hesitated for a moment, then clasped Tim’s hand firmly. The weight in his chest didn’t vanish, but it shifted, transforming into a sense of purpose. 

As Tim returned to his pacing, Zach sat back down at the computer, his fingers moving across the keyboard with newfound focus. He would take that speaking engagement Bud Turner had offered him. The protocol wasn’t just a tool anymore. It was his responsibility, his chance to turn fear into something meaningful.  

And he wasn’t going to let anyone, least of all himself, get in the way of that.
