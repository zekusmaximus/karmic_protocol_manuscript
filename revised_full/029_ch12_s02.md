Bud watched Frank leave, the door clicking shut with a finality that echoed in the room. He sat back, eyes drifting to the darkened computer screen that reflected his own tired face. The silence buzzed around him. He’d built his career at the fragile intersection of technology and policy. But this felt different. Like staring into an abyss where the path forward blurred into darkness. 

He pulled up Constance’s contact information, fingers hesitating over the keyboard before he began drafting an email. The keystrokes sounded too loud in the otherwise empty room. Whatever came next, Bud knew they were about to cross a line that couldn’t be uncrossed. 

Before sending the email, Bud’s gaze shifted to the folder containing the speakers’ presentation transcripts and videos. The urge to procrastinate warred with the need for clarity. He clicked it open. 

Hearing the simplicity of Mulvaney’s language again drew him up short. No bluster, no feverish proclamations about market share. Only plain, earnest words that spoke of using technology to help people find peace in an ever-chaotic world. 

“The retreat center has never charged for its services. “Each word resonated with quiet conviction. “This technology, like meditation itself, should be freely available to anyone seeking clarity and understanding.” 

Bud’s brow furrowed. Frank’s certainty about hidden agendas and market machinations echoed in his mind, but faced with this speech , so plain, so devoid of the usual self-serving ambition, Bud felt the first crack of doubt. He’d nodded along with Frank’s theories, agreed as O’Hearn outlined conspiracies of social engineering. But now, a quiet dissonance stirred within him. 

He closed the file, the screen’s glow a cold reminder of his task. Returning to the email, he pressed on, though the weight of the words felt different now, laden with hesitation he couldn’t afford to show. Good intentions, he reminded himself, didn’t guarantee good outcomes. Still, as he typed, he found himself choosing his words with more care than usual.
