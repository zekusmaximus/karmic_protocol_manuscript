Once seated at his desk, he opened the box. Two notes lie inside: one in a small envelope, and another simply folded, bearing the word Awaken. The weight of the word gnawed at him. He slipped the envelope open, the paper trembling slightly in his hands as he read, “Dearest Bud, I wanted you to have one of the first. Thanks again for inviting me to speak at the conference, and I sincerely hope you consider using this gift… perhaps after you’ve raised your son to be as kind of a man as you have turned out to be. Yours in gratitude, Timothy Mulvaney.” 

The note fell from his fingers, landing silently on the floor. Mulvaney. Bud’s mind raced. His breath caught in his throat. How had Mulvaney known he had a son? 

Bud snatched up his phone, pulling up the security footage from that morning. His stomach sank as the screen showed Tim Mulvaney, casual and smiling, walking up to the front door at precisely ten a.m. Bud’s eyes narrowed at the grainy image. 

He switched to the garage camera, tracking Mulvaney’s exit back to a nondescript van parked across the street. He squinted at the screen, cursing the angle that kept the license plate hidden. 

His gaze drifted to the headset inside the box. It was sleek and black, the initials KP etched in an even darker shade along the side. He ran his thumb over the engraving, a shiver traveling up his spine. 

He unfolded the instruction sheet. Sparse and vague, it offered no real warnings, only cryptic language. Bud’s brows knitted together. Was this how they intended to spread it? A mass enlightenment through unmarked, enigmatic devices?
