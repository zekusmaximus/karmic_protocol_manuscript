Tim looked briefly around his cell, then lay back on the cot and closed his eyes. The wheel was in motion.  

Recalling the admonition of the one of his handlers, “You think you’ve done the world a favor? Countries are tearing themselves apart trying to decide whether to embrace your ‘truth’ or bury it under martial law,” he couldn’t help but smile. 

He recognized that change comes gradually, and that many people find comfort in familiar perspectives, even when those perspectives bring them pain. The concept of impermanence and suffering remained universal human experiences that everyone eventually confronts in their own way. Some would find insight through witnessing how others navigated these challenges. They had offered a perspective on managing life’s inherent difficulties, but couldn’t force anyone to accept it. 

I am responsible for the effort, not the outcome, Tim reminded himself. His effort now needed to focus on maintaining composure despite his predicament. One of his favorite lines of poetry drifted to mind: be still and wait without hope, for hope would be hope of the wrong thing. 

He was stuck here until those in power decided he wasn’t a threat anymore. No one would mount a rescue mission; he was certain of that. An escape attempt would only stoke their fears. No, he was here for the duration. He would keep answering their questions and thanking them for their so-called hospitality. He reminded himself that those hardest to love were often the ones who needed it most, but this situation was testing that belief to its limit. 

Tim’s thoughts turned inward, revisiting the code. He visualized each line, the acceleration of insight, the foundation of awareness, the truth of suffering. Somewhere beyond the walls of his cell, the world was fracturing. He imagined markets someday freezing, the hum of commerce reduced to silence as ambition gave way to stillness. Governments teetering, some lashing out to suppress the new truth, others crumbling under its weight. Traditions long revered beginning to wither, their rituals exposed as hollow in the face of deeper understanding. Yet in that chaos, he could foresee something blooming, a quiet, enduring resolve in those who had embraced the awakening.
