"They're terrified," Tim said, settling back onto the cushion across from her. "Not of getting caught. Not of the technical risks. They're terrified of exactly what they say they want."
"Like you. You're holding so tight," Sherry continued. Not a criticism, not a suggestion to let go. Just a clear seeing aimed to strip away all his defenses.
"Someone has to," Tim said, but even as the words left his mouth, she recognized their emptiness. "Someone has to…" He trailed off. "My brother died looking for this. He died trying to find what you're sitting in right now." His voice cracked. "He died still searching."
"And now you're afraid," Sherry said, her words like light through fog, "that if you really look, if you really see what we've built, you'll have to face that it was always this simple. That he didn't have to die searching."
"How do I…" he started, his voice barely a whisper. "How do I keep running this program, keep watching it work, keep sending people through that door, knowing…" The rest of the sentence dissolved into a sob he apparently couldn't contain.
"Knowing I could have saved him," Tim finally managed, the words scraping from his throat raw. "Knowing if I'd just figured it out sooner, coded faster, seen clearer…" His hands clutched Michael's beads so tight the pattern pressed into his palm. "Knowing he died right here in this building, searching for what we've turned into ones and zeros."
"You're still searching," Sherry said.
"I don't know how to do this," Tim said, in what Sherry knew was a confession.
"The dharma will find its way," Sherry repeated, her voice steady, as certain as the pull of gravity or a heartbeat.
"He tried to tell me," Tim whispered, his voice rough. "At the end, when the drugs weren't working anymore, when meditation wasn't enough… He said, 'Timmy, it's right here. It's always been right here.'"
"We built this whole machine," Tim said, gesturing at the headset, "to show people what they already are. Quantum mechanics, neural interfaces, AI, it all sounds, but it's just a mirror."
"How many lines of code?" Tim asked, his voice cracking. "How many thousands of lines just to… to…" His hand trembled over the headset. "Just to make it impossible to look away anymore? To force people to see what's been staring them in the face their whole lives."
Sherry remained motionless, just being in this moment with her friend. She noticed a new faculty within her. She made her presence expand, holding space for this terrible understanding.
"We turned consciousness into a code," Tim continued, "using algorithms to mirror what meditation and sacred rituals have done for ages. AI now guides people to the doorway my brother tried so hard to reach."
"Is this what everyone's going to see?" he asked, his voice barely audible. "When they put on the headset? When the quantum processors spin up and the AI guides them through? Are they all going to see what a cosmic joke this is? That we built the most advanced technology in human history just to…"
Sherry saw into Tim then, with that faltering question, as she saw into every corner of the meditation cell, every shadow of every light thrown about the space, every texture of every piece of clothing she wore. She knew he didn't want an answer.
"Let's meditate awhile," she said, adjusting her posture. The invitation needed no further explanation. Tim's breath caught before he exhaled, settling into the stillness with her as the light shifted, touching the room with a quiet, awakened presence.
