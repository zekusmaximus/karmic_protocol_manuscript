Cray sat in his dimly lit office, the glow of the monitor casting harsh light across his face as he read Trout’s preliminary safety review. The withdrawal announcement had gone out as planned, wrapped in layers of carefully worded assurances about ongoing monitoring and future safety protocols. Political theater, he thought, a thin veil over the administration’s calculated inaction. 

The buzz of his phone interrupted his focus. He glanced at the message from his Vatican security contact: “Meeting confirmed. Will send secure details.” A sense of resolve tightened his chest. Clara’s image flashed in his mind, as did the Harbridge simulations, , consciousness rewritten, society teetering on the brink. 

The administration might gamble on religious freedom and political survival, willing to accept the risk of societal collapse. But Cray’s oath to protect and defend didn’t come with caveats. Sometimes that duty required stepping into the shadows, making the decisions that others shied away from. He accepted that long ago. 

He began drafting a message to Trout, detailing the next phase of their plan. Let the protocol’s supporters bask in their victory; let them believe the fight was over. The victories that mattered most, Cray knew, were often those unseen. 

Beyond the window, the city’s lights glimmered like watchful eyes as he worked late into the night. Strategy notes, points of pressure, a map of battles yet to come filled the space around him. The protocol might officially move forward, but in reality, its temporary reprieve was conditional. As long as he and Trout understood what was at stake, it was never beyond their reach. They would find a way to stop it. 

His phone vibrated again. Another message from his Vatican contact: “Preliminary review of evidence concerning. Further discussion required.” 

A grim smile played at the corner of Cray’s lips as he typed out his response, his chest tightening. Losing one battle meant little when the war was far from over. This war wasn’t fought for land or power but for the core of human consciousness itself. 

The protocol’s supporters had passion, public favor, the backing of rhetoric. But Cray and Trout had something stronger: unwavering conviction, a silent, unstoppable force. They would wield every tool available, unseen and tireless, to protect humanity, even when humanity couldn’t see the danger or refused to accept the shield.
