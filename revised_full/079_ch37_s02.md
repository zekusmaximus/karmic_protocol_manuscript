The room shifted as he left. Paul’s eyes met Jessica’s, his shrug resigned but knowing. 

“He’s going into the lion’s den,” she said softly once the door clicked shut, a pulse of worry running through her. 

Paul’s smile was small but certain. “It’s what he lives for,” he said, standing up with a stretch. “Especially after being surrounded by federal agents while a class of his constituent’s children got the field trip of a lifetime.” 

“I was there, Chief,” Jessica reminded him, the memory as sharp as broken glass. “Doesn’t change the fact that the only reason Congress is letting him testify is because this happened in his district.” 

“That, and we have friends on the Committee of Inquiry,” Paul added as he reached for the door. “In the meantime, check again if the state police have turned up anything on Sato. Yost is obviously concerned for her safety.” 

Jessica watched him go, the door closing behind him with a muted thud. The state police, much like the Governor’s office, would avoid this mess. No one wanted to touch it, not with stakes this high and risks this volatile. She rubbed her temple, frustration pulsing beneath her skin. There had to be another way to find out if Cray or someone else had gotten to Tim. Arresting him outright would be too public, too official, it would have guaranteed him a lawyer. 

For a moment, she sat still, her weight heavy in the chair. Admitting it, even to herself, was hard: Jessica Everett was stumped. Contacting Zach or any of the other dharmapalas was out of the question, with one possible exception. A sliver of hope stirred as she reached for her private cell phone and powered it on, the screen’s glow casting a pale light across her determined features. 

Who else at Homeland Security could she approach? Agent Gile. The memory of the tablet factory incident surfaced, a sharp reminder of the tension-filled briefing where Cray had pushed her and another agent forward to placate the Senator. She’d never expected to speak to Gile again, but she still had her card somewhere. 

A sudden realization struck her: Senator Yost might be digging deeper than she’d thought in preparation for his testimony. He might be seeking an off-the-record insight, something unofficial, to bolster his stance. Jessica felt a rush of determination flooding her veins as she stood, already scanning her desk for the card.
