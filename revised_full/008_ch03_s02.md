"Hey, what's new?" Joe, a programmer from O'Hearn's company, asked, sidling up with an easy grin. Bud had come to appreciate Joe's sharp mind and dry humor during joint projects funding tech classes at state universities.
Bud smirked, swirling his drink. "Your chairman just all but assigned me a task like I report to him."
Joe's eyebrows shot up. "Frank? Is it the neural interface stuff?"
Bud nodded, the tension from earlier returning. "Yeah, and it feels bigger than my new job title."
Joe leaned in, voice dropping. "Wouldn't be surprised. One of our execs was asking about regulations and platform bans, domestic stuff, if you catch my drift."
The unease in Bud's gut deepened. "Let's grab coffee tomorrow. We should talk more."
Joe nodded, raising his glass in agreement. "Congratulations, Bud. They're lucky to have you."
"They sure are," Bud said with a smile, setting down his empty glass and signaling the bartender. "Seltzer, please."
Eric, the regular bartender, filled the glass and leaned in, a teasing glint in his eye.
