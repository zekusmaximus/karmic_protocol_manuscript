The door clicked shut, and the echo of Guy Whitman’s footsteps dissolved into the silence of the hallway. Marcus remained still, his hands resting on the desk, his breath steady. The classroom exhaled with him, a subtle creak in the floorboards, the soft hum of the air conditioning. It was all part of the same pulse, the same rhythm, as natural and inevitable as waves meeting the shore. 

The desk beneath his palms seemed alive, not in any mystical sense, but in the way its grain carried the memory of the tree it once was. He felt the sunlight filtering through the window, not as warmth on his skin but as light itself, ancient and infinite, crossing countless miles to be here, now. The chalk dust in the air swirled lazily, each speck a galaxy in its own right, its path shaped by imperceptible eddies of air. Everything was as it should be. 

Guy’s question still hung in the room, more persistent than his footsteps: “If everyone can be everything, how do we know who we are?” 

Marcus had let the question sit, knowing it didn’t need an answer. He could have said, “You are the answer.” He could have pointed to the sunlight or the desk or the dust and shown him that the question itself was a kind of forgetting. But words were a closed loop, and enlightenment was the breaking of all loops. 

The paper on the desk fluttered faintly in the breeze from the vent. Marcus watched it settle again, its stillness a kind of peace. The moment was everything: the weight of the air, the shifting light, the memory of Guy’s frustration carried away like vapor. Marcus felt it all without grasping, without dividing. To be enlightened wasn’t to transcend, it was to include. To hold the entire universe in the curve of a single breath. 

He rose, his movement seamless with the room. The doorframe was cool under his hand, its grain a mirror of the desk’s, a quiet echo of the tree it had been. He thought of Guy and the urgency behind his questions, the desperation to know, to define, to contain. There would be time for answers, or better, for silence, but not yet. Not now. 

For now, Marcus stood in the stillness and smiled, feeling the classroom hold him as gently as he held it, one seamless whole.
