Later,time dissolved as she sat in meditation, the day and night merging into a seamless continuum after utilizing the protocol and removing the headset. Being, breathing, feeling the world. What needed to be done had been done. The sense of striving that had tethered her to this life had released its hold. The fuel that once fed her desires, aversions and suffering had been spent. There were no words, no thoughts, only awareness. 

A knock on the door interrupted the quiet. The sound of knuckles rapping on wood cut through the stillness. The doorknob turned, metal components clicking softly, and the door eased open. A subtle shift in the air reached her, a whisper of a breeze. 

A voice, familiar and tentative. “Georgia,” her assistant called, a note of hesitation in his tone. The door opened wider, his head peeking in. 

“Yes,” she responded, her voice serene, suffused with compassion. He stepped inside, his movements careful as he approached the small bag on the table near the door. Slinging it over his shoulder, he continued into the room, the air shifting as he moved. He picked up the headset and placed it in the bag, the action done with practiced efficiency, just as they had practiced. 

He turned back to her, his eyes searching for reassurance. “The car is waiting,” he said, the hint of urgency unmistakable. She followed him, leaving without a backward glance. 

The hallway stretched before them, sterile and familiar. The press of the elevator button, the chime that announced its arrival, the mechanical hum as the doors parted. They stepped in, and he pressed the button for the garage. The doors slid closed, and the elevator began its descent. Georgia met his eyes, offering a gentle smile that made him shift uncomfortably. 

“Thank you,” she said, her voice steady, almost tender. 

“Of course,” he replied, a trace of tension easing from his posture. “We have a long ride ahead of us. Are you thirsty?” 

She nodded. Yes, water. He was already reaching into the bag, pulling out a bottle. The cap twisted off with a scratch of plastic against plastic before he handed it to her. She drank, the cool water gliding over her lips and down her throat, grounding her in the moment. 

“We have snacks in the car if you’re hungry,” he said, taking the bottle when she finished. He returned it to the bag with a practiced movement. 

The elevator came to a stop, a slight jolt announcing their arrival. A chime, sharp and electronic, sounded from the speaker. The doors slid open to the basement garage, colder and more humid than the floors above. 

The sound of rubber on concrete drew her attention as a car rounded the corner and pulled up in front of them. The assistant slid in first, shifting to make room for her. She settled into the seat, the door closing with a soft thud once she was inside. The car accelerated, and inertia pressed her back against the seat. 

“To the cabin,” her assistant instructed before the car reached the garage exit. A chime from the car responded, longer and confirming. 

He placed the bag on the floor and reached into a side compartment, pulling out a protein bar. 

“How do you feel?” he asked, his eyes studying her face with concern. 

Georgia turned to him, the weight of the question settling in the air. “I feel awake.”
