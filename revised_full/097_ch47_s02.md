Fifteen minutes later, Whitman sat in Foreman’s classroom, the chalk dust mingling with the metallic tang of anticipation. The unnatural order of the space struck him; a classroom in this neighborhood shouldn’t be this immaculate. He scanned the room again, gang tags scrawled outside the window, glaring through the glass like specters of the life outside. 

“You were Force Recon,” Foreman stated, breaking the silence. His tone was flat, assured. 

Whitman’s jaw clenched. “How did you…” 

“The way you set up observation.” Foreman’s voice carried the weight of shared history, one soldier reading another. “Classic Marine approach. I used to do the same.” 

Whitman’s eyes narrowed, searching for any sign of deception. “Used to,” he repeated, letting the word hang like an accusation. “Before you used the protocol. I know this is a distribution point, Foreman.” 

A flicker of something unreadable crossed Foreman’s face. “Sadly, you have been misinformed.” He gestured around the room, the smooth motion somehow disarming. “Sometimes a school is only a school.” 

Whitman’s patience snapped. “Some school,” he said, his voice cutting like a blade. “I read the reports.. Fewer discipline issues. Better attendance. Grades are all over the place though.” 

“They’re learning there’s another way to…” 

“To what?” Whitman’s tone dripped with disdain. “Surrender? Is that what you learned in the Corps?” He stood, the chair scraping against the floor with a harsh squeal. “America wasn’t built on acceptance. It was built on competition, on never backing down.” 

Foreman’s expression remained infuriatingly calm, the quiet reproach clear in his eyes. “And how’s that working out?” he asked, voice low but resonant. “These kids have seen more violence than we did in combat. They don’t need more warriors. They need…” 

“They need to know how to survive in the real world,” Whitman shot back, fists clenching at his sides. “Not this… spiritual bypass.” 

A faint smile tugged at the corner of Foreman’s mouth. Whitman’s hand twitched, an instinctive reaction to an enemy’s provocation. 

“Where is your headset?” Whitman’s voice dropped, sharp and insistent. “The one you used to turn yourself into this,” He spat the words, unable to find an insult biting enough. It wouldn’t matter; it would roll off Foreman’s disciplined demeanor. “Did you give it to one of these kids?” 

“No, I did not,” Foreman replied, his calmness unwavering, needling at Whitman’s simmering anger. “You know it wouldn’t work for them. It was the only one I’ve ever seen, and it’s been passed on. To another adult interested in ending their suffering.” 

Whitman took a step toward the door, the weight of frustration anchoring each movement. He paused, a parting shot clawing its way up his throat. “You were a Marine. You took an oath.” 

“I still serve,” Foreman said, almost too softly. “I just don’t serve fear anymore.” 

Whitman’s teeth ground together as he forced himself to leave, shutting the door behind him with more force than he intended. So much for finding a protocol distribution point or leads onto the whereabouts of Sato, or if another manufacturing facility had started up.
