Guy Whitman adjusted the focus on his binoculars, eyes narrowing as students trickled into the rundown inner-city school. Six hours of surveillance and still no sign of possible protocol distribution. The routine churned in his head, but there was something else, a feeling gnawing at the back of his mind that he couldn’t quite shake.

He had read the file cover to cover: former Special Forces, decorated combat veteran. Yet none of the paperwork had prepared him for the unsettling composure with which Foreman moved. The precision, the unbothered calm, it made the hairs on Whitman’s neck stand on end. 

Foreman stopped abruptly. Whitman’s chest tightened as Foreman’s gaze locked in his direction. Concealment and distance suddenly felt irrelevant, as if the barrier between them had dissolved. The subtle nod Foreman gave only cemented the feeling. Whitman forced himself to breathe.
