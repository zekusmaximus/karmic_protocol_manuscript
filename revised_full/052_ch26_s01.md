In his office, Bud’s eyes remained glued to the livestream replay. He’d never seen an operation unfold quite like this, it looked clean, professional, by-the-book enforcement. But the sight of those kids’ faces gnawed at him, making his stomach clench. One girl in particular kept drawing his attention. She had been beaming as she showcased her new tablet, right up until the agents burst in. The way her expression crumpled haunted him. He hadn’t set this up, and didn’t think it was a particularly good idea, but he recognized his involvement nonetheless. 

Bud paused the video, pressing his fingers to his tired eyes. The intel had been good, hadn’t it? The justification solid? But watching armed agents storm into what was a children’s tech education event felt excessive. Like using a sledgehammer to swat a fly. Worse, it felt like something Frank would have signed off on, not him. When had they veered from reasonable caution into paranoid overreach? 

The buzz of his phone snapped him back. Probably O’Hearn, eager to strategize damage control. Bud ignored it, letting it vibrate against the desk. The little girl’s face lingered in his mind, an unwelcome echo reminding him of the type of enforcement he’d green-lit without hesitation. He had joined government relations to steer innovation, not to instill fear in children under the guise of protection. 

With a weary sigh, Bud closed the video window. There were meetings to attend, statements to draft, narratives to control. Yet beneath the surface, something within him had shifted, a tiny crack in his once-unwavering certainty that refused to be ignored.
