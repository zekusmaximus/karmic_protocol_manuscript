At lunch, Zach made his way to the banquet hall and let the energy of the moment settle in. Conversations around him rose in volume, blending with the shuffling of chairs and the hum of post-presentation discussion. He barely had time to process before Jessica Everett appeared at his table, a smile brightening her face. 

“Mind if I join you?” she asked, her eyes meeting his. 

“Not at all, not at all,” Zach said, standing and offering a slight bow, a gesture that felt both formal and playful. He pulled out the chair beside him, the anticipation of their earlier conversation making the moment feel significant. 

“Everyone, this is Jessica Everett. She works in policy at the state senate,” Zach said as Jessica sat down. “Jessica, this is our Board Chair, Frank O’Hearn,” he continued, motioning at Frank, who gave a casual wave. “Joe Bronski is one of our ace programmers, and Celeste Klein is our vice president of sales.” 

The others acknowledged her with nods and smiles as the waiter placed the salad course in front of each of them.  

“So, what did you all think of the presentation?” Jessica asked, picking up her fork and idly moving her salad around her plate. 

Zach paused, weighing his response. “I thought Tim may have sensationalized aspects of the protocol a bit, but he certainly captured everyone’s attention.” 

“I’d say,” Joe interjected with a smile. “It’s all anyone was talking about during the break. One of our freelancers is doing amazing work with quantum algorithms. What’s her name?” he asked, looking at the others, “Sarah something.” 

Jessica pressed Zach further. “So, do you not believe the protocol actually enlightens people when they use it?” 

Zach felt a flicker of defensiveness rise. “What I believe is of little consequence,” he said with a slight smile. “I always applaud unique applications of modern technology, especially in the health and wellness sector.” 

Frank leaned in, eager to join the conversation. “Our company dabbled in that sector once. If I recall, there was a lot of red tape, not to mention the challenge of getting insurers on board to cover it through health plans. It was a meditation app that was aimed at curbing addiction” 

Celeste nodded, catching Zach’s eye with a smile. “Yes, except for exercise games, it’s tough to push those applications to market. Even apps meant to be mini-therapists can’t get covered, despite the evidence of success.” 

Joe, clearly restless, shifted in his seat. “Speaking of red tape, you did a great job arguing against over-regulation last night, Zach,” he said, steering the conversation back to familiar territory. 

“Thanks, Joe,” Zach replied, allowing a grin. “It was a bit dry, but I think I hit on all the points Frank and the legal team wanted me to.” The table erupted in laughter as Frank chuckled and nodded. 

“You certainly did,” Frank said. His tone turned more serious as he addressed Jessica. “And I hope you and the senators you work for remember those points when you’re in the back room making decisions on how our industry will be regulated. We’ve managed to strike a good balance that allows real innovation.” 

“Like the Karmic Protocol,” Jessica noted, her eyes searching Zach’s. 

“We’ll definitely be watching with interest as that project develops,” Celeste added. “Donations and goodwill might have gotten them this far, but bringing something like that into the mainstream will need significant capital.” 

Joe leaned back in his chair, a wry smile playing on his lips. “Well, if it really enlightens people like they say, I hope the mainstream isn’t too quick to embrace it. How would we sell more VR headsets if everyone’s sitting around staring at their navels all day?” 

The table erupted in laughter. The conversation drifted into lighter topics. Zach, though outwardly engaged, couldn’t help but feel what they’d discussed tugging at him, a reminder that the intersection of technology and human experience was far from simple. 

 [SCENE: CH11_S04 | POV: Ed | Location: Jeta's Grove]

Far from the convention center halls, Ed kneeled in the garden at Jeta’s Grove, his hands sinking into the soil. The earth was cool and soft, carrying the faint scent of roots and decay. The rhythm of his trowel was slow but deliberate as he worked through the weeds, careful not to disturb the tender shoots pushing up toward the morning light. His back ached, but the sensation felt distant, like an echo. 

Skillful means, he thought, pausing to study a beetle navigating the labyrinth of stems and leaves. The phrase had come to him often since the protocol, less like a mantra and more like the shape of his days. Every action felt precise now, not because of effort but because there was no resistance, just movement, the simplest path forward. 

There was no longer the need to get it right. That was the greatest surprise. Before, he had always carried a weight: the pressure to measure each decision, to anticipate every outcome. But now, certainty had become irrelevant. The choices he made, whether in the garden or at the table, were neither perfect nor flawed—they were simply the next steps in a larger pattern he could glimpse but never grasp. 

A vine curled around his wrist, its tendrils startling in their delicacy. He traced the pattern with his thumb, marveling at the quiet intelligence of its design. The vine didn’t strategize or weigh its options; it reached for the sun, bending and twisting until it found what it needed. Skillful means, Ed thought again, as he gently guided the vine toward a lattice. 

He stood, brushing the dirt from his hands, his gaze drifting to the horizon. Somewhere beyond the hills, there were meetings and debates, people angling for position or pressing for certainty. He had been one of them once, locked in the same cycles of ambition and hesitation. He could still hear their questions, their doubts, even now, though they no longer troubled him. 

A sparrow landed on the edge of the garden bed, its small body taut with energy. Ed watched it tilt its head, its dark eyes scanning the soil before darting down to claim an insect. It flew off without hesitation, its movements seamless and unburdened. That was the lesson, he thought—not inaction but flow. To move with the world, not against it. 

He kneeled again, his hands returning to the soil. The weeds would come back, and the vines would need more tending. There was no end to the work, but there was also no rush. He smiled faintly as he pulled the next weed, feeling the warmth of the sun on his back. 

The garden thrived not because of perfection but because of care, because each act—no matter how small—was enough. He was a fully enlightened being.
