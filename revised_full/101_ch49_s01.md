The sterile blue light of the office flickered faintly as Gwen Trout stared at the brain scans glowing on her monitor. Neural pathways shimmered with clean precision; each illuminated connection spoke to her with an unwelcome truth: the protocol had altered something fundamental. But it wasn’t the kind of alteration she had anticipated. No visible harm. No trauma. Just the cold, clinical language of enhanced cognitive flexibility and improved emotional regulation. The terms rang hollow in her mind, stripped of the urgency they should have held. 

Trout pressed her fingers to her temples, feeling the dull ache from too many sleepless nights. Containment had been her life’s work, keeping dangerous technologies tightly controlled. Now, the data in front of her seemed to mock that effort to find harm, the creeping realization settling in her gut like a stone. The protocol had outpaced their safeguards, slipping through the regulatory net she’d spent years constructing, unraveling it thread by thread. 

The soft creak of the door jarred her from her thoughts. She glanced over as one of her researchers stepped into the room. He hesitated, and she caught the flicker of uncertainty before he spoke. 

“They’re saying Cray’s pushing harder now. Legal measures, sanctions, anything he can throw at the protocol,” the assistant said, his voice faltering. “But… he doesn’t appear to be slowing it down, does he?” 

The words settled heavily between them. She reached out and flicked off the monitor, casting the room in cold, muted darkness. “No,” she said, her voice soft, almost resigned. “He’s not.” 

Stepping closer, his searching gaze in the dim light, as if he expected her to provide answers she no longer had, he spoke, “How did we let it get this far? We had the mechanisms in place, the regulations, the oversight. We should have been able to stop this before it spread.” 

A sharp pang of guilt cut through her. “I thought we could,” she admitted, fingers curling tightly together to keep them from trembling. She focused on her hands, willing herself to appear composed. “I thought the system was strong enough. That if we just filed the right reports, used the right levers of control… we could stop it. But it’s moving faster than we can.” 

The assistant collapsed into the chair across from her, his frame sagging under the weight of his unspoken fear. “We testified before Congress. We told them the protocol was dangerous, a threat. But they didn’t listen.” His head shook slowly, haunted by memories she could only guess at. 

Trout turned abruptly, the movement propelled by frustration and a desperate need for motion. The city lights outside flickered like distant, indifferent stars, oblivious to the chaos unfolding within her world. “This isn’t what was supposed to happen,” she whispered, more to herself than to him. “The system was supposed to protect us from things like this. It wasn’t supposed to fall apart.” 

The silence in the room thickened, broken only by the distant hum of traffic outside. Trout pressed her hand against the cool glass, her breath fogging its surface as she stared at the cityscape blurred by the glow of streetlights. The belief that the right rules and oversight could protect the world from the unknown had defined her career. But now, with the protocol spreading like wildfire, even that certainty felt like a lie. 

“What do we do now?” the assistant’s voice, brittle and hesitant, cut through the silence. “What’s left for us?” 

Trout’s hand dropped from the window, her shoulders slumping under the weight of everything she couldn’t articulate. She turned to face him, meeting his gaze with eyes shadowed by exhaustion and doubt. “I don’t know.” 

The words settled heavily in the room. The assistant sat in stunned silence, head bowed, but his lips moved with no sound. Trout moved across the room and sat beside him, the chair creaking as she leaned forward. “We could try to delay it,” she said, her voice low and flat, each word tasting of defeat. “Make them jump through hoops, slow the process, buy time. But even that feels… pointless.” 

 “Delay it for what? Another year? Another month? What’s the point, Gwen, if we can’t stop it?” 

Her fingers dug into her palms, the sting was a reminder of her helplessness. She wanted to offer hope, to say that there was still a chance that they could turn the tide. But the words stuck in her throat. Because deep down, she wasn’t sure she believed it anymore. 

“We keep going,” she said finally, though the resolve in her voice was paper thin. “We do what we can… until we can’t anymore.” 

The assistant nodded, the movement weak and resigned. When he stood, his movements were slow, deliberate. Trout’s gaze followed him, a mix of pity and understanding churning inside her. They were both caught in this spiral, playing a game they were destined to lose, trying to hold back the inevitable.
