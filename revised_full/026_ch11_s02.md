The morning session broke into three smaller groups, and Zach found himself navigating through the hall toward the one where Tim Mulvaney would be speaking. Unlike Zach’s own presentation the day before, this was a more intimate setting. It seemed to have drawn a respectable crowd. He spotted a few familiar faces: senators, commissioners, even a couple of federal officials. 

There was a buzz of interest that hinted Tim’s talk would be anything but dull. Zach’s mind drifted back to when Carly had first asked Tim to speak for the retreat center about the protocol. He remembered Tim’s initial surprise, how Carly’s stance on publicity had seemed to shift after that first news story. He had been surprised no other articles had appeared. The fears that once crackled like static around the edges of conversations had died down; people hadn’t grasped what the protocol truly did from the one article. Zach wondered if today’s session might finally bridge that gap. 

As the host’s voice rose above the chatter, Zach settled into his seat, notes forgotten as he focused on Tim’s expression. “Please welcome Tim Mulvaney, here to speak about the use of virtual reality in meditation practice.” 

There was sparse but expectant clapping as Tim stepped to the podium, shuffling his notes one last time. 

Zach leaned forward, a sense of anticipation building. This could be the moment everything started to shift, especially if Tim really explained the full ramifications of the protocol. 

“Good morning,” Tim began, folding his notes and placing them neatly on the podium. Zach noticed the slight tremor in Tim’s hands. “I must admit I’m not a practiced public speaker, and I’ve never given a talk to such an esteemed audience.” The crowd responded with a few polite chuckles, easing some of the tension in the room. 

Zach leaned back in his chair, a hint of a smile forming. Tim’s delivery was genuine, earnest in a way that set him apart from the more polished speakers. 

“What I lack in experience, I more than make up for in enthusiasm,” Tim continued. Zach could see his eyes widening, lighting up his friend’s face. “Hopefully, some of you will share that enthusiasm before my time is up this morning.” 

Tim tapped the podium lightly before speaking again. “Let’s start with a question for you: why do people meditate? Anyone, just shout out an answer if you have one.” 

“To lower their blood pressure,” someone called out, prompting laughter around the room. 

“Yes, yes,” Tim acknowledged with a nod. “Why else?” 

“Reduce anxiety,” came another voice, followed by a ripple of answers. 

“Increase creativity.” 

“To clear the mind.” 

“Mindfulness.” 

Zach’s eyes darted around as Tim nodded along, his energy building with each response. Then, unexpectedly, Jessica Everett’s voice rang out from the back, drawing Zach’s attention. “To attain enlightenment.” 

A flicker of surprise crossed Zach’s face. 

Tim pointed at her and clapped, kicking the room’s energy up a notch. “Aha! The original reason to meditate! The attainment of enlightenment. I must admit, the other answers are better for the website and flyers advertising meditation practices. Sitting silently for hours on end with some undefinable and possibly unattainable goal sells fewer seats, for sure.” 

Zach’s watched as Tim paused and reached into the podium, pulling out a sleek virtual reality headset. The attendees shifted forward with renewed interest. This was the moment Zach had been waiting for, the intersection of their worlds, and maybe, just maybe, the key to understanding what the protocol truly meant. 

“Now this,” Tim said, lifting the headset so everyone could see it, “as you all know, has many uses. Doctors can simulate surgeries, you can box a heavyweight champion fighter, architects can create stunning renderings of buildings, you can practice zoomba with a zebra, board members across the globe can sit next to each other in a virtual boardroom, and of course, you can save the universe with a lightsaber.” 

Zach noticed the laughter ripple through the room. He could almost feel the tension lift as the crowd settled into the comfort of humor and relatable examples. 

Tim’s voice shifted, drawing Zach’s focus back to the podium. “Now, what if, through the immersion created by artificial intelligence and using this incredible technology, you could accelerate your meditation practice so that, instead of a lifetime, or even many lifetimes, it took only hours, or minutes, to achieve enlightenment?” 

A ripple of surprise swept across the room, and Zach watched as eyes widened at the claim. He sensed the change in the room’s atmosphere. 

“By enlightenment,” Tim clarified, his voice steady and serious, “I do not mean mindfulness, or anxiety reduction, or lowering your blood pressure, although all that comes with it. I mean full and complete spiritual enlightenment, being completely awake to reality as it is, like the Buddha or numerous religious and spiritual figures have talked about throughout human history.” 

Zach’s heart picked up a beat as he scanned the room. No one was glancing down at their phones or shuffling papers. Every eye was locked on Tim. This was more than a tech demo, it was a revelation, and the audience felt it. 

Tim continued, “We at the retreat center created a virtual reality program run by artificial intelligence, which we call the Karmic Protocol. It runs on a headset like this one, no magic, no blessed microchips or anointed circuitry. When you put a headset on and run the protocol, you are immersed in a meditative virtual reality space.” 

Tim raised the headset to his face for a moment, and Zach felt a twinge of anticipation coil within him.. 

“The artificial intelligence protocol uses several modern ideas,” Tim said, “such as eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, binaural tones, and retinal feedback. These tools are used to accelerate and authenticate the insight experience.” 

Zach could feel the charged silence in the room. This was no longer a presentation, it was the first step into uncharted territory.Top of Form 

Tim set the headset back down, sweeping the room with his gaze. “I was led to believe that while there are some tech experts here, many of you don’t have engineering or computer programming degrees.” 

The small chuckle that followed put a bit more ease into the room. “That’s good because neither do I,” Tim added, earning a few light laughs. “Far from it, actually. But I’ll do my best to provide more than just a layperson’s outline of the specifications of the hardware and coding behind the program.” 

Tim’s posture shifted, standing a bit taller as he launched into the technical overview. “Think of it like learning to ride a bike. The protocol doesn’t force enlightenment, it shows your brain what that state feels like and helps you maintain it until you can recognize it on your own. The AI adapts to each individual’s neural patterns, finding the quickest path to stable awareness.” 

There were subtle nods from the more technical minds in the audience. Even those less versed in programming seemed intrigued. Tim explained the protocol could run on a standard VR headset, but significant upgrades were essential for full functionality. Zach remembered the painstaking process of those enhancements: specialized audio components, electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, and retinal scanners to enable real-time feedback. 

Tim gestured as he described the details, moving into the more complex areas of circuitry and processors. Zach was impressed with how effortlessly Tim seemed to weave in technical terms he’d absorbed during the project’s development. It was far from simple talk, but not so dense that the audience would tune out. 

“Now, for the programming,” Tim said, his tone shifting with a hint of pride. “The artificial intelligence model relies on machine and deep reinforcement learning, supported by personalized algorithms using affective computing and sentiment analysis of the feedback data we receive.” 

The note-taking seemed to intensify, keyboards clacking a little louder. 

“Oddly enough,” Tim said, leaning into the podium for emphasis, “we mapped traditional meditation states using EEG patterns and neural oscillation data. That allowed us to develop algorithms that guide users’ brains into those same coherent states. The framework came from Buddhist texts, which provided a blueprint for understanding how consciousness shifts during meditation.” 

Zach’s chest tightened with a strange mix of admiration and anticipation. Tim was sharing not just the outcome but the journey. The innovation that came from blending ancient wisdom with cutting-edge technology. 

“We had to revisit the very roots of programming language theory to create a unique code that would allow the AI to learn and animate this virtual reality space,” Tim said. 

Zach noticed the sudden stillness in the room - people who’d been fidgeting with pens or checking watches now sat frozen, eyes locked on Tim. The usual tech-talk skepticism had vanished from their faces. What Tim was describing wasn’t just another product roadmap; it was like watching someone pull back a curtain on tomorrow. For the first time, Zach could actually picture how the technology they’d been discussing in hypotheticals might reshape what it meant to be human. 

“The challenge,” Tim continued, “was that the protocol runs very differently for each individual who uses it. Some report little to no visuals, while others experience distinct shapes or even full scenes. Some hear steady, higher-volume tones and sounds, while others might only get faint chimes.” He paused, and Zach could tell Tim was assessing the room, noticing the blank stares and furrowed brows. Zach shifted in his seat, recognizing the momentary disconnect. Tim needed to pivot. 

“We each perceive the external world through a series of lenses that our minds have created over our lifetimes,” Tim said, his voice gaining a conversational tone that Zach knew would reel the audience back in. “The protocol takes each user as they are and removes the scales, layer by layer, from their eyes, so to speak. It acts as a mirror for your thoughts, reflecting your brain’s activity back to you and guiding you with visual and audio cues to help maintain focus and avoid distractions. Using real-time feedback, the protocol helps the brain gradually reach deeper states of meditation.” 

Zach saw heads nodding now,. felt a renewed sense of pride for how deftly Tim navigated the room’s shifting energy. 

Tim lifted the headset again, its reflective surface catching the overhead lights. “What really enabled this type of application, beyond the innovative AI, was the immersion a traditional platform simply couldn’t provide. The experience of complete audio and visual focus, combined with the sensation of being in an entirely different space from your physical surroundings, allows the protocol to function as a meditation accelerant.” 

The audience’s expressions turned thoughtful, and a security guard focused in on the talk for the first time. This was more than technology; it was a leap in understanding human consciousness. 

Tim’s tone shifted, a spark of conviction brightening his eyes. “I’m not one who buys into the idea that we live in a time that is more materialistic, hedonistic, or depraved than any other era. But what I do know,” he emphasized, his voice resonating through the room, “is that we live in a time that has explosively evolved in scientific, psychological, and technological advancements. We know more about how the material world works than any generation before us, down to the subatomic level, and that includes knowledge of our own psychology and physiology.” 

Tim’s words carried weight, not just as an insight into technology but as a reminder of how far they’d come and where they were heading. The moment felt electric, they were on the brink of something significant. 

Tim’s last point resonated. Attendees nodded in silent agreement as Tim continued, waving the headset for emphasis. “At the retreat center, we’ve turned our focus to harnessing all the accumulated progress in these fields to bring peace, understanding, and awakening to the world, one individual at a time.” 

Tim raised the headset high, drawing the presentation to a close. “I wanted to thank the organizers of this event for inviting me to share how our retreat center has broken major ground in virtual reality. This isn’t like any other application you’ve heard about here, or maybe anywhere. It’s not designed for sale, with no micro-transactions, no donation requests and no profits have been or will be made. This isn’t about entertainment, information, advertising or social networking. Enlightened beings, the ones I have come to know, find little use for those things. The Karmic Protocol is about elevating and awakening our conscious experience of the world. With the ultimate goal of ending all human suffering.” 

Zach saw Bud Turner stand from his seat in the front row, moving to the podium and extending his hand to Tim with a practiced, authoritative ease. “We thank you for coming and sharing this fascinating use of technology,” Bud said, his voice carrying through the room before he turned to the attendees. 

“I look forward to seeing you all at the luncheon,” Bud said, stepping away from the podium with Tim by his side.
