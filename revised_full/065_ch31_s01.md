“Oh, and there’s a package for you,” Cheryl said, almost as an afterthought. Bud’s eyebrows shot up. He hadn’t expected anything. Arriving home early from work, he had been content to spend a rare hour with George, whose constant shifting between smiles and tears was a reminder of how fast he was growing. Bud’s chest tightened with affection at the thought of his son. 

He walked to the front foyer and spotted the package: a plain, unmarked box. Picking it up, he felt the weight in his hands, then turned back to Cheryl in the living room. “Did it come by courier or something? There’s no label,” he said, a note of suspicion creeping into his voice. 

“A nice gentleman dropped it off. I think he hoped to catch you at home,” she replied, her casual tone sharpening Bud’s senses. 

“Did this nice gentleman have a name?” he asked, a sudden tightness in his chest. 

“Tim Melenie or something like that, I think,” Cheryl said. Bud’s face went cold. The name echoed in his mind, erasing any doubt. Without another word, he bypassed the living room and went straight to his basement office, his pulse quickening.
