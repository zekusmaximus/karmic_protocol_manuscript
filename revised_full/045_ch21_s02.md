Seated in the driver’s seat, Zach opened the package. His brows furrowed when he saw it contained a simple, cheap cell phone. There was no note, no return address, nothing to indicate who had sent it or why. The fact that someone knew he would be at the spa at this specific time, especially since he’d booked the session on a whim, sent a shiver through him. 

The sudden ring of the phone made him flinch, his pulse quickening. For an instant, he considered tossing it out the window, letting it tumble across the highway median. But whoever had arranged for this had gone to great lengths to reach him. With a deep breath, he picked up. 

“Hello?” he said, his voice edged with hesitation, the rush of anticipation tightening his chest. 

“Zach! Glad you got my gift.” The voice on the other end was unmistakable: Tim Mulvaney. Zach’s mind raced, he hadn’t heard from Tim since the conference, and in the whirlwind of recent events, he hadn’t stopped to question the silence. Things must be dire if Tim need to resort to such elaborate measures to talk to him. 

“Did you lose my regular cell phone number?” Zach asked, the question slipping out before he could contain his sarcasm. 

Tim’s voice took on a familiar wry tone. “Hey, my abundance of caution has paid off every step of the way since the protocol went public. How are you holding up?” 

Zach felt his jaw tighten. “How am I holding up?” he echoed, the frustration bubbling over. “Well, let’s see: because of our little project, I’ve lost my job, been arrested on charges of corporate espionage and a slew of other accusations I don’t fully understand. Oh, and I’m probably unhireable in my field. And now, thanks to this,” he gestured at the phone, knowing Tim couldn’t see, “it seems either one or both of us are under constant surveillance. I’m not sure I’m holding up at all.” 

“At least you got some time in the tank,” Tim said, a short laugh escaping before he caught himself. “Listen, I don’t know who’s watching whom, or if anyone really is, but I needed to talk to you, and this was the best way my extremely paranoid mind could come up with.” 

Zach couldn’t help a slight smirk at that. The humor, however strained, was a welcome reprieve. “Why do you need to talk to me?” 

“I figured we should exchange information,” Tim continued. “Not sure if you heard, but they raided the hermitage section of Jetta’s Grove too, in addition to the retreat center portion. Apparently, some of our enlightened friends have been brought in for questioning.” 

Zach’s stomach tightened. “The hermitage I hadn’t heard about,” he said, the unease creeping further in. “I imagine when they only found five working prototypes at the center, they assumed we were starting mass production out there.” 

Tim let out a nervous chuckle. “Yeah, well, they didn’t find anything because there was nothing to find.” 

Zach’s thoughts raced. “Did they take any of the others in?” 

“Oddly enough, no,” Tim replied. “They had names from the notes they seized at the retreat center. But here’s the strange part: those who were there say that even though the others were right in plain sight, the agents didn’t approach them, didn’t question them, almost as if they didn’t see them at all.” 

Zach couldn’t suppress a wry grin. “That’s just what we need, miracles of invisibility in the middle of a federal investigation.” 

Tim ignored the comment and pressed on. “Oh, I almost forgot to mention,” he added, as if remembering an afterthought. “The phone isn’t the only present I got you.” 

Zach raised an eyebrow, half-expecting another wild twist. “Don’t tell me you left a 3d printed gun at my therapist’s office,” he joked, letting out a dry laugh. Tim joined in, the shared humor lightening the tension for a moment. 

“Even better,” Tim said, a note of excitement in his voice. “With the help of Ms. Sato, I managed to get you a lawyer, a good one, to support the one you had to scramble to hire.” 

“Georgia Sato?” Zach’s eyes widened, skepticism mingled with surprise. “I know she donated the land, and has meditated with us, but why would she help you help me?” He caught himself and quickly added, “Not that I’m not grateful.” 

Tim’s tone shifted, more serious now. “We’ve been working on a little project of our own,” he said. “And we’re going to need your help to finish it.”
