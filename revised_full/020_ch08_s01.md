Bud Turner glanced down at his phone to check his messages. “I’m in to speak if there is still a slot open.” The brief text from Zach Goodman stood out, stark against the screen’s light. Bud blinked, momentarily thrown. The request to have Zach speak at the upcoming legislative summit had nearly slipped from his memory. Sliding his phone back into the snug pocket of his suit jacket, he noted with mild surprise how long it had been since the topic of government bans on virtual reality platforms crossed his mind. 

A quiet chuckle escaped him as he recalled his past obsession. Back when he wasn’t juggling new job responsibilities, preparing for fatherhood, and overseeing renovations on the house. The irony wasn’t lost on him, life’s demands had a way of shifting priorities. He pulled the phone back out and replied to the text, “You’re in, details to follow.” 

Nothing substantial had come of the talk of bans. Just the usual debates on taxation, advertising regulations and data privacy. Marketing had once again triumphed over regulation. People had not only adapted to artificial intelligence but embraced it. Logging into virtual realms had become commonplace. For shopping, gaming, movies, and even those odd online exercise classes like Zoomba. 

He mentally filed Zach’s name on the summit’s agenda, it was one of the final slots left. The more challenging spot to fill was the mega-church pastor who had moved his entire ministry into virtual reality. Bud smirked at the thought; if only more legislators knew their way around the tech, the entire summit could be hosted in VR. Next year he thought as he pushed open the door to the coffee shop, the smell of fresh ground beans and cinnamon wafting toward him. 

The shop was buzzing with energy, the afternoon crowd filling nearly every table. Bud felt the familiar comfort of being surrounded by people. He thrived on it, and moments like this reminded him of why. As he stepped into the line, he pondered what had made Zach change his mind about participating. Perhaps the board president’s pressure tipped him over the edge, or perhaps Zach viewed it as a strategic advantage for his career advancement. 

Out of the corner of his eye, Bud noticed patrons bypassing the line to grab their pre-ordered drinks or tap their selections into self-serve kiosks. He had done that himself on occasion, but today, he wanted to engage in the ritual of ordering face-to-face. It wasn’t a question of trust, his order was too simple for that: a regular hot coffee and sometimes a piece of fruit. But he valued the momentary exchange, however small. 

Standing on his toes, he gave his calves a stretch and moved up to place his order. 

The hot coffee felt warm and steady in his hand as he maneuvered through the crowded tables. Spotting a lone, smartly dressed woman at a corner table, Bud’s smile broadened. “Commissioner,” he called out. “Fancy seeing you here!” 

“Bud Turner,” Constance Henning replied, her smiled radiant as she stood for a brief embrace. Constance wasn’t one to let caution overshadow an old friendship. 

“Let’s walk; it’s dreadfully crowded in here,” Constance said, leading Bud out into the street. Bud followed, an unspoken understanding between them. These meetings were rarely by chance. Occasionally, one would call the other to plan a get-together, sometimes just to catch up, but more often to discuss matters of mutual concern. Pretending they’d bumped into each other had become a playful tradition over the years.
