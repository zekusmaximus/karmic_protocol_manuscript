That evening, Tim sat silently in the passenger seat of Jessica’s car, Zach looking on from the back seat. Jessica spoke, “I had to ditch a tail this morning. They’re watching me more closely since the hearings.” 

Tim noticed Zach’s sudden shift, his body tensing as he processed her words. The calm they had carefully preserved was once again splintering. “You sure we weren’t followed?” Zach’s voice, though measured, betrayed an edge of doubt. Tim watched him as he glanced at the navigation system, his face tightening when he recognized the address: Jeta’s Grove. 

Zach was then one who broke the brief silence, “Do you think the arahants are actually Buddhas?” 

The question caught Tim off guard, piercing through the tension like an uninvited specter. He studied Zach’s profile, noting the deep line between his brows. The concept had haunted Tim too: could full Buddhahood be reached with circuits and code? 

Jessica’s eyes narrowed as she mulled it over. “I don’t know,” she said slowly. “Someone’s last life, full escape from death and rebirth….” 

Tim’s thoughts drifted to the tales of ancient powers: omniscience, the ability to discern truth, the weight of knowing every consequence. He shivered at the idea, realizing the immensity of what was at stake. 

Zach, too, seemed unable to let go of the idea. “The power to see all past lives, inherently discern truth, know the effects of every action by every person…” His voice carried the reverence and fear the thought deserved. 

Jessica gave a slight nod, eyes on the road, the glow of the dashboard reflecting off her features. “I guess we’ll see,” she said, her tone neutral. “What would you do if you knew this was your last life?” 

Tim stared out the window, the night swallowing their path as the question rooted deep inside him, refusing to let go. 

“Honestly, I always kind of assumed I’d get just the one,” Tim said, a soft chuckle escaping him. The idea of reincarnation had always felt abstract, something outside the realm of his practical beliefs. But lately, the protocol was shaking up everything he thought he knew. “I mean, if I attained Buddhahood and did know this was my last life, I guess I’d do what’s expected, alleviate suffering, be a light unto myself, all that good stuff. What about you?” He glanced at Jessica, curious. 

She hesitated, eyes drifting away to the blur of scenery passing by outside. “I’m not ready to be enlightened.” The words were barely audible, laced with a vulnerability that surprised him. “Is that bad?” she added, her voice lower. 

“It’s honest,” he said, the answer coming instinctively. Tim studied her profile, the subtle tension in her jaw. “What’s the rush, anyhow? I’m absolutely sure that given enough time, enlightenment is inevitable.” He tried to keep his tone light, but the weight of their situation pressed on him. 

Jessica’s eyes flicked back to the road, her fingers tightening on the wheel. “What if it isn’t?” she asked, her voice carrying a sharp edge. “Or what if this human incarnation is our one chance to get off the wheel for eons and eons, during which we may experience suffering we couldn’t even imagine in this existence?” 

Tim felt a shiver run down his spine. “That’s pretty dark,” he admitted, the thought gnawing at him. His mind spun with the possibility: what if each new life came with diminishing clarity, each incarnation pulling a person further from skillfulness, deeper into the grip of suffering? The notion seemed unnervingly plausible. “Still, the odds that we were born at a time when enlightenment is within reach… they’re astronomical.” 

Silence wrapped around them until Jessica spoke again, her voice taut. “Do you ever wonder if we’re doing the right thing?” Her eyes stayed fixed on the road, but Tim could sense the conflict thrumming beneath her composed exterior. “My whole career, everything I’ve built in the Senate office… it seemed so important.” 

Tim weighed her words, his chest tightening. “Having second thoughts?” he asked, keeping his tone neutral, though he already suspected the answer. 

“No. Maybe.” Her voice trembled, a stark contrast to the Jessica he was used to. “I keep thinking about my sister, she’s been in therapy for years trying to find peace. The protocol could help her, help so many people. But if we fail…” She didn’t finish, but the tension in her knuckles as she gripped the wheel told him enough. Tim thought of the headlines he hoped didn’t come: teachers walking out mid-lesson, pilots abandoning cockpits, entire systems fraying at the edges under the weight of a society chasing enlightenment. Yet here they were, ready to risk it all, convinced the answers lay ahead. 

Tim felt a pang of guilt. He knew Jessica wasn’t wrong. He thought of the life he’d carefully built, the semblance of normalcy he clung to, the coffee shop he visited religiously, the quiet solace of his apartment, the chance to start over away from the chaos. 

“Things are going to be more complicated going forward,” Jessica said, her gaze shifting from Zach to the road ahead, her eyes clouded with unspoken worries. Tim caught the change in her expression and felt a pang of apprehension. Whatever she was thinking, it couldn’t be good. 

Tim’s thoughts drifted. He knew Jessica had been offered a new position, a sign of the stability she’d craved for years. But here they were, inching deeper into uncertainty. He understood the sacrifices they were all making, but Jessica’s were on another level. The quiet tenacity with which she navigated her double life made him both admire her and feel a sliver of dread on her behalf. 

“The more complicated the problem,” Jessica said after a moment, her voice breaking the silence, “usually the simpler the solution.” 

Tim’s eyebrows rose, a half-smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “That’s deep, Jessica. You sure you didn’t go through the protocol while I wasn’t watching?” 

“Far from it,” she said, her tone dismissive but softened by a hint of exhaustion. 

Zach chimed in, “Why are we going to Jeta’s Grove? Shouldn’t we be staying away from there?” He kept his voice steady, though tension tightened in his chest. 

Jessica’s head tilted slightly, as if she were surfacing from deep thought. “One would think,” she said, her eyes refocusing.  

Zach shifted uneasily, weighing her confidence against the gnawing uncertainty in his gut. “Still risky,” he said, glancing out at the dark road. The familiar city lights had long been replaced by shadowy outlines of trees. Tim’s eyes flickered to the woods, a nagging feeling stirring in his chest. He couldn’t shake the sense that someone was watching, waiting for their arrival. “In your car and all?” 

“Oh,” Jessica replied, her tone light but laced with intent. “We’re not going in the main entrance.” 

Tim’s pulse quickened as the car slowed and veered onto a narrow, dirt path. He watched Jessica’s practiced hand kill the headlights, plunging them into a deep, almost suffocating darkness. 

“You said there’s no surveillance on Jeta’s Grove anymore,” Zach said, a sliver of doubt slipping into his voice. Tim tensed, feeling the weight of each word settle like a stone in his chest. 

“Probably not,” Jessica said, her voice steady but her eyes scanning the woods. “But O’Hearn’s hired private security. We caught one of their drones last week.” She reached into her bag and pulled out a small, sleek device. “Signal jammer. Should give us cover for about half a mile.” 

Tim took in the dark woods stretching before them, feeling the weight of Jessica’s preparation. The trees loomed like silent sentinels, and the air inside the car grew thick with anticipation. Zach’s face was pale, eyes darting to the black expanse beyond the windshield. “If they catch us…” his voice wavered, betraying the fear he was trying to mask. 

“They won’t,” Jessica said sharply, her tone resolute as she gripped the steering wheel. But she glanced at Tim, the hard edge of her expression softening for a moment. “But Zach? After this, there’s no going back. You sure you’re ready?” 

Tim’s heartbeat quickened as he watched Zach hesitate, the silence stretching unbearably in the confined space. Before Zach could answer, headlights flashed briefly in the distance, and Tim tensed, eyes darting to Jessica. The moment passed, and darkness enveloped them again. 

The sudden appearance of a figure emerging from the woods made Tim’s breath hitch. The shadow detached itself from the trees, and in the dim light, Tim recognized Finn, moving cautiously toward the car. 

Zach’s shoulders sagged slightly as relief washed over his face, and Tim felt a similar surge of reassurance. Finn’s outline became clearer as he approached, illuminated by the car’s faint interior light. He knocked once on the window, and Jessica unlocked the door. 

Finn slipped inside, the cold night air trailing him. “My friends, welcome,” he said, his voice low. The camaraderie in his tone, despite the tension, made Tim’s chest tighten. “I’m sorry for all the cloak and dagger, but we must be exceedingly careful from here on out.” 

“It’s so good to see you, Finn,” Jessica said, twisting in her seat to give him a brief nod. The expression of relief on her face mirrored what Tim felt deep down. “We were all so worried when you went silent.” 

“A necessary deception,” Finn replied, the corner of his mouth lifting in a wry smile. Tim could see the exhaustion etched into his features, the lines deepening around his eyes. “My little holiday at the hands of Homeland Security confirmed they’re still very much interested in stamping the protocol out completely. But no matter, the dharma will find a way.” He gestured to the window, the faint shadows of the outside world framing his silhouette. “They think suppressing us will stop this, but it’s already spreading faster than anyone can contain. People are realizing the benefits.” His voice softened, tinged with awe. “And I can’t blame them.” 

Tim felt a mix of admiration and anxiety churn in his stomach. Finn’s resilience was a testament to how far they’d come, but it was also a stark reminder of what they were up against. The thought made his fingers tighten unconsciously around the seat. 

“We have much to discuss and not a lot of time,” Tim said, glancing at Jessica before meeting Finn’s eyes. His gaze was steady, holding an unspoken challenge and trust. 

“I don’t understand why they would just let you go after all that,” Zach interjected, breaking the silence, his voice colored with doubt. 

“Neither do I, fully,” Tim admitted, a shadow crossing his face. “But I suspect we may have allies in unlikely places. In any case, it has allowed me to reconnect with all of you and move to the next phase of our work.” 

“The next production run of the protocol,” Jessica said, a note of understanding in her voice as they walked. Tim’s heart swelled with a mix of pride and urgency at her words. 

Zach exhaled slowly, his shoulders relaxing as he looked over at Jessica. Whatever lay ahead, there would be no turning back now. 

“You were successful then, Finn?” she continued. 

“Beyond our wildest hopes,” Finn replied, a smile spreading across his face. “I made effective use of my months abroad. Our silicon bodhisattvas await.” 

Tim noticed Zach’s slight shiver, a shadow of doubt crossing his expression. What they were discussing wasn’t lost on any of them.
