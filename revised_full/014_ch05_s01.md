He held out for months, but Zach Goodman had finally allowed Bud Turner to secure an appointment on his calendar. Zach hadn’t paid much attention to the noise outside his door until Mark, his reliable gatekeeper, called out, “Mr. Goodman will see you now.” Zach’s gaze flicked to the clock on the wall, marking the time with a resigned nod.  

Bud slipped through the door with a practiced smile. Zach’s eyes followed his movements, assessing him as he took a seat. “Mr. Turner,” Zach said, his tone neutral as he pushed aside a draft report, “I hope traffic wasn’t too bad this morning.” 

Bud’s response was automatic, and Zach noted the slight uptick in his voice, the kind people use when trying to set a casual tone. “Not at all, I actually came in early to run some errands before heading over, so I missed it today.” 

Zach glanced at his sparse, impersonal office before focusing back on Bud. “Nice, always good to avoid rush hour,” he replied, adjusting his posture. “So, there’s a conference coming up, and you couldn’t find anyone at your own shop to talk about artificial intelligence in virtual reality?” 

The corners of Bud’s mouth twitched upward. Zach couldn’t help but notice how Bud’s eyes darted around the room, taking in the bare walls and the uncluttered desk. “We don’t want to have all the fun,” Bud replied. His voice was smooth, calculated. “It’s an industry-wide affair, and as I said in my email, I think you are particularly well-suited for this topic.” 

Zach’s eyebrow arched slightly, a practiced move. He wasn’t new to flattery, and he met Bud’s eyes with an expression that hinted at skepticism. “Yes, you did say that, but I’ve been scratching my head as to why. I’m just a mid-level manager overseeing the creation of a zebra-themed fitness app.” As far as anyone in his professional life was concerned, that was true. 

Bud’s grin widened. Zach noticed how Bud’s hands moved, almost theatrically. “I’m sure it will be a smashing success,” Bud said, his voice laced with good-natured sarcasm. He leaned forward. “But that’s not what you’ll be talking about. You’ll be discussing the effects of over-regulation on innovation.” 

The statement hung in the air, Zach’s eyes narrowing slightly as he took it in. His desk’s neatness weighed on him. Bud’s voice cut through Zach’s momentary distraction. “You worked on a medical application that didn’t get off the ground, right?” 

Zach’s attention snapped back to the conversation and leaned forward. “Someone’s done their homework,” he said, the tone light but guarded. He adjusted his glasses with a push of his index finger. “But that project wasn’t a casualty of over-regulation. It fell to unprofitability. I’m confident we could have navigated the FDA’s labyrinth, though it would’ve been a nightmare for compliance.” 

“Exactly!” Bud interjected. “How many ideas don’t even make it to the boardroom because of compliance?” 

Zach chuckled, a dry sound. He felt the tension ease slightly as he leaned back. “If we’re being honest, not nearly as many as the ones that die in sales meetings.” 

Bud’s eyes lit up as if a door had cracked open. “Now you’re getting somewhere,” he said. Bud inched forward, his hands clasping together with a muted clap. “What if the FCC or Homeland Security decided to regulate platforms or ban them outright? It happens in other countries. Can you imagine?” 

A subtle chill settled over Zach. He didn’t flinch, but the question echoed louder than it should have. He’d asked questions like that himself, though with different intentions. The pause felt heavy, and he forced himself to reply quickly, to control the narrative. “If the FCC or Homeland Security wants to ban Zebra Zoomba, they’re welcome to try,” Zach said, his tone sharper, dismissive. “But I’m not your guy for this topic, Bud. The conversation should be about how over-regulation impacts profitability. Innovation is resilient. Ban something, and people will only want it more.” 

Zach kept his expression neutral, but he felt the sharp edge of Bud’s persistence. Bud’s seemingly casual demeanor didn’t fool him; Zach could sense the probing behind those steady eyes. Bud was fishing, and Zach wasn’t entirely sure what he hoped to catch, but Frank’s cryptic remarks from a few weeks ago and Bud’s subtle digs now confirmed that someone had been connecting dots Zach hadn’t even laid out yet. He forced his mind to stay calm, to resist the urge to reveal anything. 

“True,” Bud said, leaning back just enough to look relaxed, but not quite enough to fully disengage. “But then our product becomes like drugs were decades ago, bad quality knockoffs no law-abiding citizen can bring to market.” 

Zach’s jaw tightened slightly. Bud’s words, delivered with a practiced ease, struck at a nerve, and he couldn’t deny the man’s rhetorical skill. 

“This is why you’re exactly the guy for this presentation. Frank mentioned you might be above the fray on topics like this when I pitched it to him. He thought you’d be good for the gig.” 

Zach’s eyes narrowed. So, Frank had been in on this. Typical. The sarcasm in his voice came naturally as he replied, “Well, perhaps Chairman O’Hearn would like to give the presentation. He’s got the name recognition.” 

He watched Bud take the verbal jab with an almost imperceptible shrug. “Hey, listen,” Bud’s tone shifted, as if revealing a card he’d been holding back. “I ran into him at a trade show while I was trying to get on your schedule, Zach. There’s nothing Machiavellian about this. Like I said in my email, your name came up through the association. I’m tasked with filling these damned slots and making it worth the legislator’s time.” 

Zach caught the subtle emphasis on ‘worth,’ another nudge that only someone in Bud’s position would consider innocuous. 

“The conference isn’t for another eight months, so there’s no rush. Give it some thought.” 

Zach nodded stiffly, but his mind was already racing. He couldn’t help but feel Bud knew something about the protocol. The eight-month timeline was a reprieve, but it wasn’t infinite. Bud stood, hand outstretched. Zach took it, feeling the firm grip that lasted just a beat too long, as if Bud was measuring something unspoken. 

As Bud turned and started for the door, he called back over his shoulder, “Why would the government want to ban a virtual reality platform? Think about it.” 

The door clicked shut, leaving Zach with the faint echo of that parting question. It settled into his thoughts like a splinter, poking at his carefully constructed calm.
