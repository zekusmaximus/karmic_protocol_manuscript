“Absolutely not!” Lawrence Cray’s voice thundered through the virtual conference room. The holographic projection flickered with his intensity. Withdrawing the cease-and-desist would send exactly the wrong message. It would legitimize the protocol’s operation, undermine everything he had worked toward. 

“The order won’t survive a First Amendment challenge,” another avatar spoke, radiating a calm that grated on Cray’s nerves. As if logic were a shield against reality, he thought. “Religious freedom trumps speculative consumer protection concerns.” 

Cray’s jaw tightened as Gwen Trout broke in, her voice sharp, cutting through the room’s tension. “This isn’t about consumer protection. The neurological alterations we’re seeing in test subjects.” 

“Are all technically beneficial by current medical standards,” one of the lawyers interjected, too quickly, Cray noted. Too neatly. “We can’t prove harm, and without proof of harm, were on shaky regulatory ground. The raid was based on an imminent threat that doesn’t appear to have materialized.” 

Cray exhaled slowly, feeling the tightness in his chest. The argument looped endlessly, logic stacked against urgency. “What about compelling government interest in maintaining social stability? The Harbridge simulations clearly show.” 

“Theoretical models won’t convince a judge,” Constance’s voice sliced through, cold and dismissive. Cray felt the frustration claw at him. She was right, damn her. “Not against actual data showing improved mental health outcomes.” 

“So, we just give up?” The question escaped him before he could filter out the desperation. His pulse quickened, a thrum under his collar. “Let them spread this consciousness-altering technology without any oversight?” 

Constance’s avatar barely moved, her expression neutral. “No one’s suggesting complete surrender. But we need to shift our approach. Focus on proper clinical trials, standardized safety protocols…” 

Cray’s fingers clenched into fists beneath the table as another attorney chimed in, their voice too measured, too certain. “The 2026 Administrative Procedures Act amendments require sixty days of public comment for any major rule. Even under emergency authorization, we’re looking at Q2 2028 before permanent regulations take effect.” 

Trout glanced at her calendar, brows drawing together. Cray noted the slight frown. “The WHO’s Global Regulatory Framework update is scheduled for their June 2028 assembly. We need something in place before then. Even so, it may be too late,” she added, her tone sinking. “The changes we’re seeing in neural architecture appear to be permanent.” 

“The administration’s position is clear,” Constance said, her tone flattening as if the debate were already sealed. “We’re not going to die on this hill. Not with midterms coming up and religious advocates mobilizing on both sides of the issue.” 

“Homeland Security claims this is an unlicensed medical device that poses risks to users. How do you respond?” the host had asked. 

“The protocol is not a medical device, it’s a tool for consciousness exploration,” Carly had replied firmly. The sound bite played again in Cray’s mind as he faced Constance across the table. 

“Politics,” Cray spat, the word tasting bitter, acidic. “While we debate classifications, O’Hearn’s using our investigation to position himself for a corporate takeover. The market moves today weren’t subtle.” 

“Which is exactly why we need to tread carefully,” Constance countered, her voice sharp with warning. “O’Hearn’s corporate raid complicates everything. If we push too hard now, we risk looking like government enforcers doing a tech giant’s dirty work.” 

“You think I care about O’Hearn’s corporate games?” Cray demanded, his frustration building. “The protocol…” 

“The protocol is part of a bigger picture now,” Constance cut in. “Think, Lawrence. Every move we make against Sato’s operations gets painted as either government overreach or corporate manipulation. O’Hearn’s takeover bid has changed the optics completely.” 

“So, we just give up?” The question escaped him before he could filter out the desperation. “Let them spread this consciousness-altering technology without any oversight?” 

Constance’s avatar moved ever so slightly, her expression neutral but her voice carrying an edge of steel. “No one’s suggesting complete surrender. But we need to shift our approach. O’Hearn’s corporate assault means any direct action we take will look coordinated with his takeover attempt. The media’s already drawing connections between the raid timing and today’s market moves. We pick our battles. This isn’t one we can win through direct confrontation, not while O’Hearn’s corporate warfare makes every government action look suspicious.” 

The meeting droned on, a mechanical extension of decisions already made in closed circles. By day’s end, Cray knew, the cease-and-desist would be lifted. The protocol could go live again, sanctioned and unstoppable. 

Gwen Trout’s office was dark, illuminated only by the soft glow of her monitor. The brain scan data haunted her, vivid and unrelenting, neural pathways, permanently altered; consciousness, transformed in ways no study had yet explained. The sharp vibration of her phone broke the silence, a text from Cray: “Need to talk. Secure line.” 

She picked up the secure line, fingers trembling slightly as she dialed. 

“They’re going to announce the withdrawal tomorrow,” Cray’s voice cut through, tense and without preamble. 

She closed her eyes briefly, letting the inevitability settle in. “I know. The attorney’s brief was convincing, at least on legal grounds.” 

“We can’t let this go, Gwen, you and I are the only ones who seem to understand the gravity of the situation.” Cray’s insistence was familiar, that stubborn fire she both admired and dreaded. 

Her eyes drifted back to the scans, data flickering like an accusation. “The FDA still has jurisdiction over neural interface devices. I’m drafting new testing protocols and safety requirements.” 

“Regulations won’t be enough,” Cray interrupted, voice sharp, as if the idea had already burned through his patience. “They’ll find ways around them. They already are. We need a bigger strategy.” 

She shifted her focus to the Federal Register deadlines on her screen, running through contingencies in her mind. “DEA scheduling could take effect immediately upon filing. If we push it through by the end of January 2028, enforcement could start before the new fiscal year funding.” 

There was a pause, filled only by the hum of her monitor. Someone else nearby muttered about the OMB’s backlog. Election year complications. 

Cray’s next words cut through the noise. “There’s a Reverend that has connections, people who understand the real stakes, who know how dangerous this protocol is, who aren’t limited by political concerns.” 

Gwen stared at the neural data, each line a silent testament to irreversible change. “Send me the details. And Lawrence?” She paused, weighing the sharp edge of her next words. “Be careful. Just because we’re right doesn’t mean we can cross every line.” 

“Sometimes protection requires prevention,” he replied, the familiar phrase grounding them both. “Even if people don’t understand what they’re being protected from.” 

When the call ended, she was left with the rhythmic hum of her office and the steady glow of the monitor. With a deep breath, she began a new file: “Preliminary Safety Review: Neurological Impacts of Quantum Consciousness Modification.” 

The supporters of the protocol had secured a victory today. But she and Cray had something stronger than momentum: the patient, relentless power of regulatory oversight. And they would wield it with precision.
