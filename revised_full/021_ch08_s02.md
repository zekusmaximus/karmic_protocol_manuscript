“How are things at the Office?” Bud asked as they strolled, the crisp breeze lifting stray strands of Constance’s hair. He knew she thrived in her role as head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, appointed at the start of the current administration. Still, he imagined she sometimes longed for the dynamic challenges of the private sector. 

“All stuffed shirts and talking heads, too much paperwork and far too little pay,” she replied, her tone playful but edged with fatigue. “My staff and I are looking forward to your upcoming summit. Any surprises I should be on the lookout for?” 

Bud smiled. “No. Just the usual seminars on why the government shouldn’t interfere, tax, or meddle with our industry.” 

Constance’s lips curved into a knowing smile as they paused at the crossing signal. “So, nothing new.” 

“Exactly,” Bud said, taking a sip of his coffee. “Just a chance to stay at a nice hotel and eat stale muffins for a couple of days.” 

They crossed the street, and Bud watched as Constance deposited her empty cup into a sidewalk trash bin. She turned back, a spark of curiosity in her eyes. “And you? Promotion, looking fit, anything else since we last talked?” 

Warmth spread through Bud. “Cheryl’s expecting.” 

“Oh, Bud, that’s marvelous!” Constance said, her face lighting up. “You and Cheryl are exactly the type of couple this world needs. Your child is bound to be a little genius.” 

Bud chuckled. “It’ll be its mother’s child if it is.” 

“Ever the humble one,” Constance said, continuing down the block. “Thanks for meeting me, Bud. It’s always good to see you doing well, not that I ever expect otherwise.” 

“Likewise,” Bud said.  

Their talk drifted to familiar ground. Tech industry policies, government procedures and upcoming hearings. Bud listened intently, nodding as Constance outlined proposed regulations, although a question nibbled at the edges of his mind. This wasn’t usually the kind of thing that prompted a face-to-face meeting. 

They turned into a small park, and Constance sat on an old wooden bench shaded by oaks. She motioned for Bud to join her. The slight tension in her posture told him there was more to come. 

“There’s a rumor you might be inviting David Charles to speak at the summit,” she said, her voice dropping to a near whisper. 

Bud’s pulse quickened. David Charles was the preacher who’d made waves by moving his entire ministry into virtual reality. 

Constance leaned in, her eyes flicking around them as if to ward off eavesdroppers. “As a friend, I’d urge you to reconsider. There may be some controversy around his ministry coming out soon, if not before the summit, then shortly after.” 

This was why Bud kept old friendships strong and made new ones with care. He nodded, allowing a small smile to play on his lips. “Oooh. I won’t ask for details.” 

“Best that you don’t,” Constance said, standing and smoothing her skirt. The light filtering through the leaves cast shifting patterns across her face. 

Bud stood too, amusement tinged with gratitude in his voice. “And I won’t ask where you hear your rumors.” 

“Good man.” Constance’s smile was back, sharp and knowing. “He probably asked for a stipend anyway.” 

Bud gave a short laugh. “He did. I’ll find someone less flamboyant for that session.” 

“I’m sure you will,” she said. “There’s no shortage of voices on religion and tech.” 

“Spirituality and technology have always had a colorful relationship,” Bud quipped. “Besides the Amish, we seem to get along just fine.”
