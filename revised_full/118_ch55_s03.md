Later that night, Bud stood over his son’s crib, watching George sleep. The baby’s small chest rose and fell with perfect rhythm, the picture of serene contentment. George existed completely in the moment, no past to regret, no future to fear. Just being. 

“Is that what it’s like?” Bud whispered, the question barely forming in the quiet of the room. The peace that Georgia had carried with her still lingered, an echo in his mind, like the memory of a song long after it had ended. He recalled how she’d spoken about being of service, how she had spent the afternoon helping him without an ounce of expectation or desire for recognition. 

. A strange certainty settled in Bud’s chest: the world was on the brink of something monumental. The karmic protocol felt like a stone dropped into the vast pond of human consciousness, and he could sense the ripples spreading, touching unseen shores. What would happen when they reached their destination? 

What kind of world would George grow up in if more people embraced that peace? The thought tugged at him, each implication rushing through his mind. If the protocol could genuinely lead to mass enlightenment, what would that mean for society? Would power structures dissolve as people turned away from ambition and control? Would religions transform or wither in the face of collective awakening? Would work and commerce shift or disappear? 

Bud’s smile faltered as his thoughts spiraled outward. It wasn’t just a machine; it was a choice. A way to rewrite the future, to strip away the ignorance and suffering that had plagued humanity for millennia. A gift. A weapon. He imagined the headset not here, in this quiet room, but in boardrooms, classrooms and war zones. Places it probably already was. It would bring enlightenment, yes, but also disruption. 

Suddenly the tension coiled in him loosened with a sharp pang of realization. He wasn’t ready for that kind of change. Or maybe he was, and that was what truly scared him. The protocol was out there now, its presence unavoidable. The choice would always be there, lingering like an open door, not just for him, but for everyone. A bridge to awakening, built in virtual reality by artificial intelligence. 

George stirred, his tiny fingers curling in sleep. A rush of love surged in Bud, fierce and profound, making his chest ache. Maybe that’s what Georgia meant. Enlightenment wasn’t about retreating from life, but being fully present in every part of it, especially the hard moments. 

Bud reached down and touched his son’s small hand, his fingertips brushing the warmth of soft skin. “Sweet dreams, little man,” he whispered. And as he stood in the silence, a forgotten truth began to surface, a whisper in his heart that felt like coming home.
