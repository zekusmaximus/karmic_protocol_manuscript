Bud reached over his desk and grabbed the television remote, turning up the volume. He preferred having the news on mute while he worked, ready to unmute it if anything caught his eye. Today, the top-of-the-hour headlines did just that. 

“Virtual reality evangelist David Charles was indicted this morning on several charges, including charity fraud, tax fraud and wire fraud. Charles is accused of redirecting legitimate charitable donations and using his virtual reality ministry to scam followers out of millions of dollars through deceptive or fraudulent credit card and bank transactions. Voxis, the platform Charles used to promote his ministry and conduct these fraudulent activities, has publicly denied any involvement.” 

I bet they have, Bud thought as he lowered the volume, tuning out the rest of the broadcast. Another one was downed by greed. The realization of how close he’d come to trouble sent a wave of gratitude toward Constance, unspoken but heartfelt. 

Bud pulled a up the file marked “Conference” on his computer and clicked to the sponsorship list. His eyes scanned the page until he confirmed it, Voxis was not on the list. Relief washed over him for the second time. While he doubted they had been complicit, their involvement would have triggered a compliance nightmare if those fraudulent transactions had passed through their payment systems. 

He scanned through a few more pages and checked the speaker list. Charles’s name was nowhere to be found, not even penciled in as a possibility. The sharp beep of an alert interrupted him; his news aggregator had picked up the story. He’d programmed it to notify him of any mention of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Leaning closer, Bud clicked on the notification to read the more detailed account. 

The article outlined a familiar tale of deceit. The only twist was that this time fraud had been orchestrated in the realm of virtual reality. A grainy image of Charles’s avatar accompanied the piece. Guilty as sin, Bud thought as he finished reading and scrolled through his feed. 

Articles on virtual reality classes at a medical college, virtual reality concerts and new headsets designed to deliver scents for a deeper experience flashed by. He skimmed through them, finding nothing noteworthy. 

Just as he was about to close the window, a headline caught his attention: “Modern meditators using artificial intelligence and virtual reality in their quest for enlightenment.” 

Here was something. Bud clicked on the link. The story, posted that morning, described a group of meditators at a retreat center who had developed a virtual reality program incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance meditation. The article offered no technical details about the program or its code, but something about it resonated with Bud. 

He leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing as he considered the potential implications. This wasn’t just another flashy product or thinly veiled money-making scheme. This was different. 

“The ultimate goal of mindfulness meditation is the alleviation of suffering,” Bud read aloud from the article, noting the quote attributed to Carly Rice, the director of the retreat center. “Mindfulness is not a religion, it is a science, so why not use the most cutting-edge technology to help us get there?” 

He nodded to himself. This was the antithesis of a David Charles scenario, low-profile, genuinely beneficial to users, and not driven by money. 

A smile played at the corners of his mouth as he navigated to the retreat center’s website. They offered ten-day introductory meditation courses and longer-term programs for seasoned participants, even a permanent living option at a place called Jeta’s Grove. He scanned the page for a contact number, dialed, and listened as the call connected. 

“Hello?” The voice on the other end was female, unpolished, and unexpected. 

Bud’s brow furrowed. No automated greeting or formal introduction, odd. “Oh, hello there. I’m looking for your director, Carly Rice,” he said, masking his surprise. 

“This is she,” the woman replied smoothly. “How can I help?” 

He glanced at the phone, momentarily taken aback before answered. “This may sound strange, but I just read an article about your use of virtual reality in meditation.” 

“That was quick; it was published just this morning,” Carly responded, her tone laced with curiosity. “And who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?” 

Bud cleared his throat. “My name is Bud Turner. I’m on the planning committee for an upcoming legislative summit on virtual reality. I hope this isn’t too forward, but I was wondering if you or someone from your center might be willing to come and give a brief talk about your work.” 

“Well, that’s intriguing, Bud,” Carly said. “What exactly would you want us to discuss?” 

“The virtual reality aspect, of course,” Bud explained. “And how artificial intelligence has enhanced your practice. Nothing too technical. We’ll have some industry folks, but the audience will mainly be legislators, regulators, and their staff. The summit is called ‘VR and AI in Everyday Life.’ We’re hoping to show decision-makers practical uses of the technology, and to be honest, what you’re doing sounds incredibly compelling.” 

“That it is, Bud, that it is,” Carly said, clearing her throat. “I’ll need to run this by my board, of course. One of our board members, Tim Mulvaney, might be a good fit to speak. Could you send me more information, like the dates?” 

Bud jotted down her email and assured her he’d forward all the details in case she had questions. Hanging up, he leaned back, a satisfied smile tugging at his lips. What a refreshing conversation, he thought as he opened a new tab to start his due diligence on the retreat center. 

A general search brought up social media posts from attendees at the retreat center, all glowing with praise. He dug deeper, checking their charitable status and clicking through their incorporating documents to see what might be hidden beneath the surface. 

Bud’s eyes narrowed when he spotted a familiar name on the board of directors. Zach Goodman. 

“Well, that explains a lot,” he muttered, leaning back with a thoughtful expression.
