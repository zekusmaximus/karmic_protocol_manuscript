As Bud walked home that night, the excitement of the evening softened into quiet contemplation. The cool air carried the scent of rain, and his mind drifted to Cheryl as she walked beside him. She'd been different lately, more centered since she started those mindfulness classes. He'd been skeptical when her doctor suggested meditation for stress, but the change was undeniable.
Frank's cryptic comments, together with Joe's hints about regulations, stirred something in Bud. Pushing back against regulations was second nature to him. "The future's coming whether we're ready or not," he often told legislators. But lately, he questioned his reflexive stance on regulation.
Cheryl had pointed it out last week. "Not everything needs disrupting," she'd said, leaning over the kitchen counter after one of his tirades. "Sometimes slow and steady wins the race."
He'd laughed it off, but her words gnawed at him now. It could be that Joe's comments bothered him. They poked at the comfort he found in certainty.
Bud shook his head, pushing away the doubt. He had a job to do, interests to protect. But tonight's conversation had left a sliver of unease that he couldn't shake.
