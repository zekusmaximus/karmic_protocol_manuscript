The room buzzed with the restless energy of too many agendas crammed into too small a space. Fiona Gile felt the oppressive weight of the room’s charged air, each competing agenda jostling for dominance in the cramped space. 

Fiona watched Frank O’Hearn pace between clusters of FDA staff and bureaucrats, his expensive suit out of place among the government-issue furniture. He’d practically moved into their field office since Homeland Security had been forced to wind down their investigation. 

“Commissioner Henning had no right or authority to destroy the evidence,” O’Hearn repeated for what felt like the hundredth time. The words struck Fiona as hollow echoes by now, their impact blunted by repetition. Next to him, a reverend, who Cray and Trout had added to their little group, nodded vigorously, his clerical collar wilting in the overheated room. The sight of the reverend’s fervor made Fiona’s jaw tighten; his righteousness grated on her frayed patience. 

“This protocol has already broken people, and led them astray,” the reverend added. “It’s a virus in people’s minds, turning them away from Christ.” Fiona resisted the urge to roll her eyes, focusing instead on the taut expression of her partner. His silence mirrored her own thoughts, these declarations were mere noise, distractions from the crisis at hand. 

Fiona exchanged a weary glance with her partner. The unspoken understanding between her and her partner was their only constant. Her partner looked as tired as she felt. The dark circles under his eyes were evidence of the sleepless nights they’d shared, haunted by the fallout from the tablet factory debacle. Their careers had nearly ended with that disaster. Now, they were tethered to this shadowy task force, even though they had been right about the mass production. 

“We have something you’ll want to see,” Dr. Trout announced, appearing in the doorway. Fiona’s shoulders tensed at Trout’s sudden entrance, the director’s usually composed demeanor noticeably strained. “The first round of testing is ready.” 

They followed her down a narrow corridor to what looked like an old interrogation room. The corridor’s cold fluorescent light hummed, matching the tight coil of anticipation twisting in Fiona’s chest. One wall was dominated by a one-way mirror, currently opaque. As they approached, the sense of foreboding deepened.
