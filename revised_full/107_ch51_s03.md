Across town another conference room was empty now, save for Christine Torres’ sister, who sat alone at the long glass table. The surface was immaculate, reflecting the stark fluorescents overhead like a still pool. She traced the edge of the table absently, her fingertips brushing over its cold precision.  

Her colleagues had left minutes ago, carrying with them the fragments of a settlement deal that had hung in the air like smoke. To them, it was a triumph, a careful dance of concessions and demands. Elena had smiled as they shook hands, nodded at the appropriate moments, and signed her name at the bottom of the page. None of it was false, but none of it truly mattered either. The protocol had unraveled her need to win, reframed what winning meant. 

Elena closed her eyes and let her breathing slow, the stillness of the room expanding around her. The silence wasn’t empty. It was alive, humming faintly with the trace vibrations of all that had passed here. The click of pens, the shuffle of papers, the slight catch in a junior associate’s voice as he delivered a point too rehearsed. Even the tension in the opposing counsel’s jaw, she could still feel it, not as a memory but as something shared, a ripple that passed through them both and faded, like a wave returning to the ocean. 

This was the essence of her work now, stripped of the illusions she once clung to. There were no adversaries, no competitors, no “other.” Every argument she made, every brief she wrote, every case she fought, it was all one motion, one story, part of a whole so vast and intricate it defied comprehension. She wasn’t here to dismantle or defeat; she was here to balance. Justice, she realized, wasn’t a scale, it was a river, and she was simply one of its currents. 

Her phone buzzed on the table, and she opened her eyes, her hand moving instinctively to silence it. The screen showed a name she recognized but didn’t cling to. Another point of connection, neither more nor less important than the hum of the air conditioning or the faint smudge on the table’s surface. 

She stood, smoothing the lines of her blazer, and glanced at the skyline beyond the window. The city stretched out before her, a labyrinth of steel and glass and movement, all of it pulsing with its own rhythm. She could feel it, the countless lives intertwining, each decision rippling outward like light through crystal. Six months ago, she would have seen it as a challenge, something to master and control. Now, it was simply beautiful. 

She turned off the lights as she left, the room slipping into darkness behind her. Outside, the city waited, and Elena walked toward it not as a litigator, not as a woman, but as a part of its vast and endless flow. Tomorrow she would practice law in her own way.
