The sound of her office door creaking open drew her gaze. The FTC attorney, whose steady hand had guided more than a few covert maneuvers in Washington, stepped in. His movements were deliberate, his expression unreadable as he closed the door behind him and spared a glance at the muted news broadcast flickering on the wall-mounted screen. 

“Ms. Henning,” he said, his voice low and controlled. “I know you’ve seen the latest. Cray’s pushing hard. O’Hearn’s scrambling.”  

Constance leaned back in her chair, staring at the muted hum of the monitors lining her office wall. The gentle whir of the air conditioning seemed louder than it should, filling the silence left by reports she no longer had the energy to review. 

Henning folded her hands in her lap, allowing the faintest trace of a smile to ghost across her lips. “Of course they are. That’s what people do when they feel the ground slipping beneath them. Do you know what this room used to feel like?” she asked, her voice low and more rhetorical than curious. “Every time I walked in here, I thought, ‘This is where we keep the chaos at bay.’ And now? Now, I look at these screens and think, ‘This is where we try to convince ourselves the chaos is still out there.’ But it’s not. It’s in here.”  

The attorney hovered a few paces from her desk, his posture tense, uncertainty flickering in his eyes. Henning caught the hesitation and gestured toward the chair across from her. He accepted the invitation, settling into the chair with a sigh that hinted at exhaustion. 

“Cray’s team just submitted a new legal strategy to counter the protocol’s spread,” he continued, leaning forward. “Sanctions, regulatory blockades, all sorts of legal wrangling. He’s throwing everything at it.” 

Henning’s gaze remained fixed on him, her voice soft, almost bemused. “And how’s that going for him?” 

A beat passed, and the lawyer’s frown deepened. “Not well. The committee’s confidence is unraveling, and momentum’s shifting in favor of the protocol. Public opinion is… complicated.” 

Henning leaned forward, her eyes narrowing as they met his. The familiar spark of insight danced behind her composed exterior. “The more desperate the fight, the clearer it becomes who has already lost.” 

The attorney uncharacteristically shifted uncomfortably, the creak of leather breaking the silence. His brows furrowed as he studied her, searching for a hint of doubt. “You sound like you’ve already written them off.” 

Her smile widened, cold and knowing. “I don’t need to write them off. They’re doing it themselves. Take your own department, for example,” Constance continued, her tone soft but deliberate. “How many agents do you have left for consumer protection enforcement?” 

The attorney hesitated, as if weighing the value of candor. “Not enough,” she admitted finally. “Ten percent of our staff is technically on leave. The other half… they’re there, but they’re not. Most of them refuse to pursue cases that don’t align with their personal values anymore. They say they can’t, in good conscience, penalize people for surviving.” 

Constance nodded grimly. “And it’s not just your department. Treasury analysts aren’t analyzing. IRS auditors won’t audit. Even at Justice, prosecutors are walking away from cases.” Her gaze dropped to her desk, where a half-filled coffee mug sat beside a stack of unread briefs. “It’s not active resistance. It’s… detachment. The kind you can’t fight because there’s nothing to push against.” 

The lawyer exhaled, his fingers drumming a restless pattern on the armrest. “They’re pushing hard, Constance. If Cray gets enough traction with these legal proposals, they might slow this down. Maybe even stall it indefinitely.” 

Henning’s eyes narrowed slightly as she studied him, assessing the depth behind his statement. “And you think that’s possible? Stalling this indefinitely?” 

A shadow of doubt flickered across the attorney’s features before he replied. “No. Not indefinitely. But maybe long enough to put a serious dent in its momentum.” 

Henning’s gaze didn’t waver, her voice steady and almost conversational. “And what happens then? When they’ve exhausted their resources and their reputations? When they finally realize this,” she made a dismissive gesture with her hand, “isn’t something they can contain?” 

Shoulders tightening as he shifted, his eyes drifting toward the window where the sun was dipping below the skyline, casting a deepening glow over the city, the attorney replied, “You think they’re losing steam?” 

“I think,” Henning said, reclining back into her chair with deliberate ease, “they’re too focused on the short game. Cray’s obsession with maintaining control, O’Hearn’s desperation to protect his legacy, the reverend’s misguided spiritual crusade… They’re all playing to win a battle that’s already lost.” 

His expression grew more guarded as he met her eyes, searching for the intention beneath her words. “And you? What are you playing for?” 

Henning let the silence between them expand, savoring its weight before answered. “I’m not playing to win this round. I’m playing to shape what comes next.” 

Brows drawing together, a flicker of wariness deepening his stare, he leaned forward. “What exactly do you mean by that?” 

Her lips curved into a more thoughtful smile. “The protocol is out there, spreading faster than they can hope to contain. Fighting it head-on, like Cray and O’Hearn? It’s a battle already lost. But guiding it, steering its evolution?” She paused, allowing the full implication to sink in. “That’s the real power. The only kind that matters.” 

The attorney leaned back, processing her words with a thoughtful frown. “You’re talking about… influencing how it’s used? Regulating its growth?” 

Henning’s expression sharpened with approval. “Exactly. Let them exhaust themselves trying to kill it. When they fail, the world will need someone who understands it, who knows how to integrate it without letting it spiral out of control. We need to be that someone.” 

A knowing edge colored the lawyer’s next question. “And you think that someone is you?” He already knew the answer. 

“I don’t think,” Henning said, her voice ironclad. “I know. Cray and the others are chained to their archaic visions of control. They want to suppress it, destroy it. But the future can’t be suppressed. It can only be shaped. And when the chaos settles, we’ll be the ones holding the reins.” 

The lawyer’s eyes narrowed as he studied Constance, she could tell he was weighing her intent. He had obviously witnessed power plays before, but her strategy was probably unlike any he’d seen, subtle, patient, relentless. She wasn’t trying to win the crowd or headline. She was positioning herself to last. 

“And where does that leave me?” His voice was measured, cautious. 

Henning’s gaze pierced him, appraising. “That depends on you. The FTC will be crucial in the coming years as the protocol weaves its way further into society. There will be regulatory frameworks to construct, legislation to steer. I need people who understand the long game, who know when to strike and when to bide their time.” 

The room’s atmosphere shifted as both turned their attention to the television. The announcer’s urgent tone cut through the quiet: “Breaking News from Washington: leaked documents reveal that several government officials have used the controversial new technology known as the karmic protocol. Internal memos obtained by this network suggest that even high-ranking federal officials, who have publicly opposed the protocol, have secretly undergone the process. Sources indicate that the number of enlightened government employees could be in the hundreds…” 

The attorney stood, his movements composed as he adjusted his tie, the gears in his mind clearly turning. 

Just as he turned to leave, Henning’s voice called him back, low but commanding. “Remember: those who survive aren’t always the ones who fight the hardest. They’re the ones who know when to let others burn out.” 

He paused at the doorway, meeting her eyes. A silent understanding passed between them, and with a slight nod, he stepped into the corridor. 

Henning leaned back in her chair, eyes drifting to the cityscape where the first specks of light blinked awake in the twilight. Cray, O’Hearn, they were all too loud, too exposed. They would burn themselves out, frenzied and spent. And when they did, she would still be there, biding her time, waiting to step forward from the shadows.
