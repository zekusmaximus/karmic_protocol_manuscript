Zach stood in the marble halls of the federal courthouse, its towering architecture above him. He watched anxious people rush by with their attorneys, papers clutched tightly, their whispers barely reaching his ears. 

Beside him, Christine Torres stood with a poise that defied the tension in the air. 

“They’ll drop the charges,” she said, glancing at her watch as if this were routine. “They have to.” 

“Have to?” Zach echoed, his voice tinged with doubt. 

Torres’s smile was thin, almost imperceptible. “Let’s just say their evidence has some… interesting anomalies. Timestamps that don’t match server logs, access records created after the fact, the kind of mistakes made in a rush to build a case.” 

Before Zach could ask more, a young, ambitious-looking prosecutor strode over, his eyes averted, his movement slow. “Ms. Torres, Mr. Goodman.” 

“Martin.” Torres’s nod was brisk. “I trust you’ve reviewed our motion?” 

“We have.” The prosecutor shifted uneasily, his eyes flicking down the hall toward the U.S. Attorney’s offices. “In light of certain evidentiary… concerns, along with the fact that some of our staff have disappeared, the government is moving to dismiss all charges.” 

“With prejudice,” Torres said, her tone leaving no room for negotiation. 

The prosecutor’s jaw tightened. “Yes. With prejudice.” 

“Excellent,” Torres said smoothly. “We’ll see the judge now?” 

The proceedings in the courtroom took less than five minutes. Zach noticed the judge’s eyebrow lift at the words “with prejudice,” but he signed the order without a word. 

Outside the courtroom, Zach turned to Torres. “That seemed… easy.” 

“Good lawyers make it look easy,” she said, slipping the dismissal order into her briefcase. “Ms. Sato chose her team well.” 

 “The civil suit will drag on, but this was their best shot. They wanted to paint you as a criminal, and they failed.” Torres smiled, a rare softness. “Sometimes that’s all people need to see.” 

Zach watched her stride away, thoughts swirling around evidence that seemed too perfect, corporate leaders who were too confident, and federal agents who acted too fast. The criminal case was over, but a gnawing sense told him his real fight was just beginning.
