A few days later Zach noted the near emptiness of the coffee shop, a setting that calmed his nerves. He sat in the corner, distancing himself from potential eavesdroppers, his personal laptop resting unopened on the table. He watched Joe approach the counter, his friend’s gaze briefly flicking his way. Joe’s expression shifted to a mix of curiosity and concern as he walked over, coffee in hand. 

“Bold move meeting in public,” Joe said as he settled into the chair across from Zach, his voice carrying an edge of caution. He glanced at his phone before silencing it. 

“They’re watching my place anyway,” Zach said, the weight of O’Hearn’s accusations gnawing at the back of his mind. “Besides, O’Hearn’s too busy today to worry about me. I hear he’s launching some kind of major acquisition.” The bitter edge in his voice wasn’t lost on Joe. 

“Yeah, the market’s been crazy. Three different Sato subsidiaries under pressure.” Joe lowered his voice. “The timing’s interesting.” He studied Zach’s face carefully. “You know, O’Hearn’s not just after the protocol. Word is he’s trying to take control of her entire tech portfolio.” 

Zach’s jaw tightened. “Using the protocol investigation as cover for a corporate raid. Clever.” He thought about Georgia’s careful maneuvering, her strategic preparation for the protocol’s production. How many fronts was she fighting on now? 

“It’s more than clever,” Joe said, leaning forward. “The government investigation gives him perfect cover. Any defensive moves she makes look suspicious. If she tries to protect her assets, it seems like she’s hiding protocol-related evidence. If she focuses on fighting the takeover, the protocol operation becomes vulnerable.” 

Zach nodded slowly, pieces clicking into place. “A trap within a trap,” he said. “No wonder she’s been so distracted lately.” 

Joe’s nod was small, almost reflexive, as he took a sip of his coffee. “The charges against you are absurd by the way. Anyone who’s even glanced at our codebase would know you didn’t steal anything,” he said. Zach caught the flicker of frustration in Joe’s eyes. “Our neural net couldn’t handle what your team built, even if you had tried.” 

Zach leaned forward, the low hum of background noise fading as his focus sharpened. “That’s what I want to talk about. You’re working on the new emotion-recognition systems, right?” 

Joe’s brow furrowed. “Yeah, but we’re having problems. Just analyzing emotions takes up so much computing power that our development servers can barely handle it.” He paused, glancing around the room before lowering his voice. “Nothing like what I heard your method could do.” 

Zach flipped open his laptop and pivoted it towards Joe. The faint whir of the machine felt louder than it was. “Look at this architecture diagram. Tell me what you see.” 

Joe’s eyes scanned the intricate maze of interconnected nodes and pathways. Zach noted the shift in Joe’s expression, the surprise that sharpened into recognition. “This isn’t a traditional neural network,” Joe said, his voice raising an octave. “Is this… quantum-inspired processing with biological feedback loops?” 

“Close,” Zach said, the hint of a smile crossing his lips. Memories of countless late nights surfaced as he spoke. “We began with standard deep learning models but found they couldn’t handle consciousness integration. So, we created a hybrid system, reinforcement learning combined with what we call it recursive awareness mapping.” 

“The processing requirements must be insane.” 

“That’s where the biological feedback comes in,” Zach said, his voice low and steady. He leaned forward, tapping the table with a finger as he spoke. “Instead of processing everything computationally, we let the user’s own neural networks within their brain handle most of the work. The AI just sets the stage and observes.” 

Joe leaned back, an incredulous smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. He shook his head slowly. “No wonder Bud’s been all over potential platform bans. This is miles ahead of anything out there.” He hesitated, his expression shifting. “One of our freelancers, that Sarah woman, has been digging into this stuff. Three major companies are now fighting over her for code reviews.” 

Zach smiled a bit, knowing who he was talking about but not letting Joe know. Sarah had went through the protocol. He was glad she was out there somewhere, still doing what she loved, from an enlightened perspective. 

“Speaking of Bud,” Joe circled back, “he’s been asking questions about you.” 

Zach felt a familiar tension coil in his chest, though he forced a smirk. “Of course he has. How’s that going?” 

Joe’s brow creased, and he glanced at his cup, swirling it absently. “He’s… worried. Not just about the company’s angle. He’s genuinely concerned about what could happen if this tech goes mainstream.” 

Zach’s gaze drifted to the laptop as he shut it, the metallic click punctuating a brief silence. He let his eyes wander to the window, where late afternoon sunlight cast fractured reflections across the street. “Funny, isn’t it? I used to be the one pushing for endless testing and safety protocols, always thinking about the consequences. But now…” His voice tapered off, a hint of something unreadable in his expression. 

Joe’s voice softened. “What changed?” 

A short, humorless laugh escaped Zach’s lips as he began packing up the laptop. “Besides the raids and federal charges?” He stood, the scrape of his chair loud against the floor. “We need to take this conversation somewhere more private. There’s something you need to see, something that will show you why I’m not afraid anymore.”
