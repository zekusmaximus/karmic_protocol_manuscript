The units were fortified with the best encryption available, outfitted with clear, user-friendly instructions, and boasted a sleek, minimalist design. The intricate layers of security showed his meticulous planning, redundant and complex enough to ensure that any tampering attempt would trigger the device to brick itself, erasing all data and frying its circuits in an instant. 

Zach thought back to the two relentless weeks of testing that had led to this moment. He had overseen quality control at every step, from the precise etching of silicon wafers to the meticulous final assembly. Tim had pushed for a faster rollout, eager to see results, eager to outwit the lawyers, the government.  

They had started cautiously producing just one unit on the first day, then five the next, rigorously testing each one offline. By the week’s end, their process had been refined enough to produce ten flawless units a day. By the second week, production had scaled up to twenty units daily without sacrificing quality. 

The true challenge, Zach knew, wasn’t the production itself but maintaining the shroud of secrecy amidst so many moving parts. Components were sourced from different suppliers, the assembly process was split across multiple locations, and the completed units were promptly transferred to secure storage. Only a select few had full knowledge of the operation, ensuring each step remained compartmentalized and protected. 

The dharmapalas had been a constant presence at the facility. Their vigilance kept any unnecessary attention at bay after their decoy operation at the tablet factory had succeeded beyond expectations. They worked tirelessly, subsisting on takeout meals, meditating when they could, and tracking media coverage. For Zach, the intensity of the work was invigorating. For the first time in what felt like ages, he had a clear purpose and a carefully crafted plan. He silently thanked Tim for involving him in this project. 

His gratitude extended to the lawyer Tim had secured for him with Georgia Sato’s assistance. The criminal charges against him had finally been dropped, and the weight of that relief still resonated in his chest. It hadn’t surprised him when his attorney unearthed the fabricated evidence and noted the conveniently missing physical proof. It had all been a setup, and Zach knew exactly who had orchestrated it. 

Zach scanned the financial news headlines with grim satisfaction as more units disappeared into nondescript packages, “Advent Industries Completes Acquisition of Sato Tech Assets,” “Corporate Raiders Find Empty Shell: Sato Operations Show No Irregular Activity.” “Market Analysts Puzzle Over Advent’s ‘Strategic Acquisition’ of Seemingly Routine Electronics Facilities” 

A deep surge of pride washed over him as he watched the next wave of units being prepared for distribution. O’Hearn had won his corporate battle, seizing control of Georgia’s tech companies. Unfortunately, he found only ordinary electronics manufacturing. Meanwhile, the real prize was already spreading beyond his reach, carried by an invisible network of believers.
