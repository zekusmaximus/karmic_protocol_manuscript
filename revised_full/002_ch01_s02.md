Georgia Sato's voice cut through the murmurs with practiced calm, the tone of a CEO accustomed to crisis management. "Please cooperate with the agents, everyone. I'm sure there's been some terrible mistake." She raised the tablet in her hand, turning it so the cameras could capture the cheerful cartoon interface. "As you can see, we manufacture educational devices for children. Nothing more."
The emphasis on "children" landed like an indictment.
Gile felt her jaw tighten. The woman was good—that perfect blend of cooperative and accusatory, helpful and damning. Every word calibrated for the cameras still recording, still broadcasting this disaster to audiences Gile couldn't control.
One of the lawyers materialized at Gile's elbow, pressing a business card into her hand with the smooth efficiency of someone who'd done this before. "Jessica Everett, legislative aide to Senator Yost. The Senator will want a full accounting of this incident forwarded to his office immediately." The woman gestured toward a distinguished man in the group of adults, his expression carefully neutral but his presence unmistakable—a state senator, surrounded by constituents and cameras, watching federal agents disrupt what appeared to be a wholesome community outreach program.
Gile tucked the card into her pocket, already calculating the political fallout. "Ma'am, I'm going to need those cameras turned off and everyone moved to a secure area while we conduct our search."
"I'm not sure that's necessary," Georgia interjected smoothly, gesturing to two men with handheld cameras who remained conspicuously in position. "This is being broadcast live. I'm confident your viewers would appreciate transparency in federal operations." Her smile didn't waver. "I'm sure they'd love to see how this ends."
The word "ends" carried weight—a prediction, a promise, a trap already sprung.
Gile signaled her team to begin. Time to find out what they were really dealing with.
Rodriguez knelt beside a pallet of tablets, scanning serial numbers with his phone. Each device registered in the federal database—legitimate purchases from authorized manufacturers, shipped to school districts across three states last month. He held one up for Gile to see. The screen displayed a cheerful educational interface, age-appropriate reading exercises, parental controls. Nothing remotely resembling neural interface technology.
"These are registered," Rodriguez said quietly. "Proper documentation, legitimate supply chain."
Gile watched another agent pull up shipping manifests on a server terminal. Clean records. Supplier contracts. Tax filings that would take an army of forensic accountants weeks to fabricate. Every document pointed to exactly what Prometheus Technologies claimed to be—a licensed manufacturer of children's educational devices.
She walked the perimeter of the warehouse, studying the layout with tactical eyes trained to spot concealment. But the organization made too much sense. Receiving area here, inventory management there, quality control stations along the north wall, shipping prep positioned for efficient truck access. Every detail consistent with straightforward distribution logistics.
Not hidden chambers. Not concealed routes. Not the covert manufacturing facility their intelligence had described.
A functioning business. Nothing more.
Her radio crackled. "Second floor clear. More inventory, all tagged and documented. Educational software, teacher training materials, warranty fulfillment center."
Gile watched Georgia Sato comfort one of the children—a girl who'd started crying, not from fear of the agents but from the confusion of having her field trip interrupted by people with badges and guns. The teacher knelt beside the girl, whispering reassurances while casting looks at the federal officers that would play beautifully on camera. Confusion. Betrayal. The government terrorizing children.
The narrative was already written. Gile was just reading her lines.
"Agent Gile." Her partner materialized beside her, tablet in hand, expression carefully neutral. "Preliminary data extraction from the servers. Manufacturing records, quality control documentation, shipping manifests. Everything's clean. Everything matches their business license application." He paused. "They're manufacturing exactly what they claim to manufacture."
"How convenient," Gile muttered.
"Very." Her partner glanced at the cameras, then back to her. "The warrant specified neural interface hardware. Unless these tablets have hidden functionality we can't detect..."
"They don't." Gile had seen enough. The assembly stations were too simple, the components too standard, the entire operation too transparent. Whatever the Protocol was—whatever technology had three governments concerned enough to authorize this raid—it wasn't here.
Had never been here.
Another lawyer approached, this one carrying a briefcase that probably cost more than Gile's monthly salary. "Agent Gile, I represent Sato Industries' technology division. I'll need copies of your warrant, the affidavit supporting probable cause, and documentation of your chain of evidence procedures. My client is cooperating fully, but we will be filing complaints with the oversight board regarding this disruption of legitimate business operations."
Complaints. Oversight boards. Congressional inquiries. Gile could see it all unfolding—the headlines, the hearings, the careful parsing of what intelligence justified this operation and where that intelligence originated.
She caught Georgia Sato's eyes across the factory floor. The CEO had moved to stand precisely centered in the space, perfectly positioned for the cameras, surrounded by children and tablets and the wholesome apparatus of educational technology. No surprise in her posture. No fear. Just the stillness of someone who'd choreographed every movement, anticipated every response, planned for this exact moment.
The open gate. The timing. The school bus that arrived forty minutes before the raid. The lawyers who appeared with impossible speed. The cameras already positioned and broadcasting.
Georgia Sato hadn't just prepared for this raid.
She'd invited it.
"Continue the search," Gile ordered, her voice carrying across the factory floor with more confidence than she felt. "Full inventory check, data extraction from all servers, complete documentation of operations."
She watched her team disperse, knowing with absolute certainty they would find nothing. Knowing that every empty crate they opened, every clean server they documented, every legitimate business record they verified would become another piece of evidence against the federal government's overreach.
The little girl had stopped crying. Her teacher had given her another tablet to hold, and now she smiled at the colorful display, the scary agents momentarily forgotten in the glow of animated characters dancing across the screen.
Gile turned away, unable to watch.
The search took three hours. Three hours of professional documentation, methodical evidence collection, thorough examination of a facility that was exactly what it claimed to be. Three hours of knowing they were performing for cameras, building a case against themselves, proving the very point Georgia Sato wanted to prove.
Federal agents had no idea what they were doing.
The technology they feared didn't exist.
The threat was manufactured.
Gile watched the sun rise through the factory's industrial windows, light spilling across assembly lines that would produce thousands of tablets for children's education. Legitimate business. Legal operations. Nothing that justified this disruption, this embarrassment, this public failure.
By the time they left, the lawyers had multiplied. Gile counted representatives from at least seven firms—corporate defense, antitrust, securities litigation, media rights, civil liberties advocacy. Not a scrambled response to unexpected raid. A coordinated deployment that had been planned, rehearsed, positioned precisely for maximum effect.
The children filed out past the federal vehicles, escorted by their teacher and several parents who'd arrived during the search. One boy waved at Gile, still clutching his demonstration tablet. She didn't wave back.
"That was a clusterfuck," her partner said as they settled into the SUV, exhaustion pressing down like physical weight.
Gile couldn't disagree. She leaned back, closing her eyes for a moment before forcing them open again. The day was far from over—reports to file, supervisors to brief, explanations to construct for why their intelligence had been so catastrophically wrong.
Except it hadn't been wrong, exactly.
Someone had provided that intelligence knowing they would act on it. Knowing it would lead here. Knowing the cameras would be waiting.
"The timing was perfect," her partner continued, scrolling through his phone. "Too perfect."
Gile opened her eyes. "What do you mean?"
He turned the screen toward her. Market alerts, stock tickers, financial news feeds. "Advent Industries filed acquisition notices on three Sato subsidiary companies. Started the paperwork the minute we entered the building—I checked the timestamps. While we were searching for Protocol hardware, someone was stripping Georgia Sato's corporate assets."
The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity.
Frank O'Hearn. Advent Industries. Corporate raider with a reputation for hostile takeovers and strategic asset stripping. She'd heard the name in briefings, seen it in intelligence reports, but always as peripheral information—a businessman concerned about regulatory compliance, a corporate voice advocating for oversight.
Not as someone orchestrating federal law enforcement to provide cover for corporate warfare.
"We're not just law enforcement," Gile said quietly. "We're corporate raiders. O'Hearn used our investigation as a weapon."
"Above our pay grade," her partner cut in, though his expression suggested he was doing the same calculations she was. "But it explains the comprehensive legal defense. Sato wasn't just protecting against us—she was defending against parallel threats. The cameras, the staging, all of it. She saw both attacks coming."
"Cray won't care." Gile thought of her superior's intensity during the pre-raid briefing, his singular focus that bordered on obsession. He'd been convinced this Protocol represented an existential threat—had shown them classified assessments, modeling data, expert testimony about consciousness-altering technology that could destabilize social systems.
He'd been so convinced, he'd never questioned where the intelligence came from or whose interests it served.
Her partner's phone buzzed again. He glanced at it, face tightening. "Georgia Sato just convened an emergency board meeting. And O'Hearn's already filed with SEC to increase his acquisition bid—up forty percent from this morning."
Gile watched the facility recede through the SUV's rear window. Sunlight glinted off fresh paint and clean windows, illuminating a legitimate business that employed real people, manufactured real products, contributed to the real economy.
A business that would soon belong to Frank O'Hearn, courtesy of a federal raid that found nothing illegal but damaged everything anyway.
"All I know," Gile said, looking up from the facility to meet her partner's eyes, "is if Cray thinks he's pinning this disaster on us when the intelligence came from his new best friend Frank O'Hearn, he's miscalculated badly. This is going to look horrible for everyone involved."
Her partner nodded slowly. "The question is whether anyone will care. Sato's company gets gutted, Protocol gets suppressed, government looks tough on emerging threats. Everybody wins."
"Except the truth," Gile said quietly.
"When has that ever mattered?"
The SUV rolled toward headquarters through morning traffic, carrying them toward reports and briefings and the careful construction of narratives that would justify what couldn't be justified. Gile felt something shift inside her—not quite doubt, not yet defection, but a question that hadn't existed before this morning.
She'd spent twenty years enforcing the law, believing that institutional authority served justice, that following orders protected people, that the badge meant something beyond the power it represented.
What if she'd been wrong?
What if the threat wasn't the technology they'd raided to stop, but what that technology threatened to expose?
Gile filed the thought away—not as conclusion, but as question. One she couldn't answer yet. One she wasn't sure she wanted to.
But as headquarters loomed ahead, as they prepared to deliver their report to superiors who'd already decided what it needed to say, Gile made a decision.
She would document exactly what they'd found and exactly what they hadn't. She would note the timing of O'Hearn's market moves. She would catalog every detail that suggested coordination between federal enforcement and corporate warfare.
And she would start paying very close attention to where their intelligence originated and whose interests it served.
If Cray and O'Hearn were coordinating—if this morning's disaster was part of something larger—then her oath required more than blind compliance.
It required her to understand what she was really enforcing, and for whom, and why.
The badge meant something. Fiona Gile still believed that.
She just wasn't sure anymore that it meant what she'd always thought.
