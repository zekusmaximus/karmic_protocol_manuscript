# VISION DOCUMENT: [Your Novel Title]

## CORE DNA
**Logline (working):** [We'll refine this together]

**Three-Layer Conflict:**
1. **Enlightenment as Liberation vs. Social Destabilization**
   - The protocol works. It genuinely awakens consciousness.
   - But mass enlightenment = people rejecting consumption, ambition, institutional participation.
   - Society's structures assume striving. What happens when people stop striving?

2. **Corporate Warfare Disguised as Governance**
   - O'Hearn exploits the protocol panic to strip Sato's assets.
   - Fiona and Cray believe they're stopping a threat; they're actually pawns.
   - Government power becomes indistinguishable from corporate power.

3. **Individual Awakening vs. Institutional Control**
   - Sherry, Tim, Georgia choose enlightenment; institutions choose suppression.
   - The personal (consciousness, peace) vs. the systemic (law, economics, power).
   - No clean resolution—both sides are right and wrong.

## TONE & STYLE
**Thrilling and Cerebral/Philosophical**
- Kinetic plot momentum (raid, corporate moves, cat-and-mouse with feds)
- Philosophical questions embedded in action, not separate from it
- Prose alternates: visceral action beats + introspective passages that *deepen* tension, not slow it
- Think: *Neuromancer*'s propulsive noir + *Cryptonomicon*'s playful intelligence + *Ministry for the Future*'s systemic urgency

**Narrative Voice:**
- Multiple POVs, each distinct (Fiona's pragmatism, Tim's conviction, Sherry's clarity, Bud's moral crisis)
- No omniscient narrator explaining themes; readers infer from conflict

## AUDIENCE & MARKET POSITIONING
**Primary:** Literary fiction readers (character complexity, philosophical depth, prose quality)
**Secondary:** Science fiction (consciousness, tech ethics, speculative systems)
**Tertiary:** Thriller readers (plot momentum, high stakes, moral ambiguity)

**Positioning for Big Five + Film:**
- High-concept hook: "A meditation app achieves what neuroscience thought impossible—then governments and corporations race to suppress it"
- Franchise potential: Series if it sells (follow other characters post-enlightenment?)
- Streaming appeal: Thriller pacing + philosophical weight + visual spectacle (raids, tech, boardrooms)
